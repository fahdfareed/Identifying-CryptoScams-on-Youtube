# Identifying and Reporting Cryptocurrrency Scams on Youtube
In this project we analyze how bots are used to comment on crypto-related videos. We intend to create such a system that given any particular video looks at the comments and then uses sentimental analysis to classify the comments into potential scams. The program them follows the recommendations of the next videos and conducts the same experiment. I want to be able to identify these potential scams and then  In extension I want to build an identifier that reports these comments as "Unwanted commercial content or spam" on Youtube. Once reported, the team at YouTube will be able to successfully identify these scams and poitentially flag the account and stop the spread of these scams.
