# Identifying and Reporting Cryptocurrrency Scams on Youtube

In this project, we analyze how bots are used to comment on crypto-related videos. We intend to create such a system that given any particular video looks at the comments and then uses sentimental analysis to classify the comments into potential scams. The program them follows the recommendations of the next videos and conducts the same experiment. We want to be able to identify these potential scams and then look into the extent in which these scams go into. In extension I want to build an identifier that reports these comments as "Unwanted commercial content or spam" on Youtube. Once reported, the team at YouTube will be able to successfully identify these scams and poitentially flag the account and stop the spread of these scams.

### Social Significance
This is the age of the internet. With the recent trend in cryptocurrency there is a huge number of people going online to learn about the activity to potentially invest in such a way that they could maximise their profits. As bitcoin reaches a greater value, every one in ten people [1] are investing into crypto currency to cash in on this trend. Using tools like robinhood and coinbase 'cryptocurrencies have become far more accessible for the average American' [2] and people who are not well-versed with technology have been learning to invest in it. According to a recent study over 'half of YouTube viewers use it to learn how to do things theyâ€™ve never done'[3] and this includes learning crypto. With a larger traffic, youtube becomes a huge platform for scammers to advertise and potentially rob the general population of their earnings. Conducting this study has a huge social impact as it will help in create such a platform where the population can safely learn without being under the threat of being scammed. 

## Background
People have been using YouTUbe to learn multiple skills and with the rise in the popularity of Bitcoin, people are using YouTube to learn Cryptocurrency. As the number of viewers increase, this becomes an attractive platform for scammers to scam people into forwarding them bitcoins with a promise of a reward. This project in collaboration with professors Gianluca Stringhini and Osama Alshaykh aims at exposing these fradulent videos.  YouTube viewers "had lost $24 million in bitcoin and related scams in the first six months of 2020"
