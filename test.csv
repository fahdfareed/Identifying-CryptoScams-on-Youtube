investing in Bitcoin and crypto currency is the best investment anyone can do this season because it has made a lot of people millionaires,0
TA is all well and good but I find it truly baffling that all major crypto youtubers just look at pure TA and completely ignore the bigger narrative of why BTC is pumping and why the future outlook might not be as rosy as it seems. It's kinda irresponsible to ignore the fact that each ETF launch so far has caused a major dump at the peaks of BTC. We were already on shaky footing with historically low volume and almost pure whale pumps narrowly avoiding a long-term bear market. This is the worst possible time in history  to invest as so many don't back up their  crypto assets.More emphasis should be put into day tradiing as it is less affected by the unpredictable nature of the market.I have made over 13 btc 4rm day tradn with Gary Bales insights and signals in less than 4 weeksthis is one of the best medium to backup your assets incase it goes bearish.,0

NFTs dont give you the rights to the image. It gives you ownership of the NFT. For example: If i sell you a Painting of a Banana you dont own the rights to the painting you just own that particular painting. Or if you buy a tattoo you dont own the rights to the tattoo you just bought the tattoo. the Tattoo artist still owns the rights to the image they tattooed on you.,0

Bitcoin and Forex trading it's a trading platform were you invest with a minimum capital you predict the outcome of foreign currency if they will either fall or increase it's like you are placing a bet but the good thing is that you are knowing the outcome before you predict that's why profits returns are always on the high but by doing this you need an experienced account manager who can help you with the basics and trades for you.,0

Everyone should give Alis excellent advice a go but if it fails or if the money doesnt make you happy a different approach is required. Perhaps Heideggers philosophy so relevant since the pandemic would be equally if not more important for those chasing materialistic goals.

If your investing experience is less than 10 years start with 5-6 portfolio. don't bet big on any single company learn the process first.. initially diversification is not that bad it really worked for me in initial years. remember that protection of capital is a must.,0

TThe trading system is a set of certain algorithms trading instructions and action of the trader on the basis of the technical analysis. In each trading system the conditions for entry/exit time intervals money management and risk management are clearly defined. Trading systems allow you to limit the factor of emotional influence on decision-making as well as to give the trade a certain degree of systemic character.

<I admire the efforts u put in your videos mate digital currencies continues to reshape the world globally its hard for for anyone going against them these days though from a trader's perspective i feel we really need more experts in the field updating newbies / lnvesttors on how the community works. crypto currencies are gradually moving towards something big and the price surge over the past few months is just the beginning of greater things to come. lots of persons are skeptical on when to buy-in the market and whether it isn't too late to buy an asset when you're hodling it could be but when trading its never too late to buy. a trader with the right strategy and indicators earns big regardless of market price (bulls or bears). I trade using signals from trade expert Larry Robinson with his guide and signal service i 've made over 27B TC worth of crypto assets over some months. only for crypto inclined issues  connect him on   @Robinson_Trade12,1

The past 10-days of correction for X'R'P was indicating that the damage to the rally could be more than expected. Consolation under $1.24 was assumed on both the mid and long-term analysis but x'r'p proved to be bullish yet again. Surging by more than 20% over the past day X'R'P was valued at $1.39 with a m@rket cap of $64.5 billion. The bullish pattern on X'R'P was evident over the past week but the depth of the correction suggested that there will be greater difficulty breaking through resistance at $1.246. However over the past 24-hours X'R'P has managed to carve a position above $1.18 and breach past 0.5 Fibonacci line at $1.246. A minor re-test of $1.416 was also completed and it was consolidating under the $1.40 mark. If you have the right professional who has a good insight into crypto trad g with the right str@tegy then crypto trad/ng will be easy and prof!table for you. I have been building my crypto asstes using the strategy and signal services provided by a pro financial analyst Mr Wilson and his trade  Signal works like magic and is highly accurate.

"""You only lose when you sell"". Yes but you also win only when you sell. Also timing IS important: if you started investing in the late 90s and retirement came by 2008-2012... well all your investments amounted to zero or negative on a 10-15 year period. And there's also the hidden assumption that the US economy will continue to do well for the next X years which might not be the case. Investing is risky even in indices even if you globalize but gains (if any!) are your reward for taking that risk.",1

"I'm sorry but ""technical charting"" does not work - there is nothing that becomes statistically significant when using the history of random events to forecast a random future.  Prove it to yourself: Take 3 dice and roll them and add up the total of 2 of them Take that total and subtract the last total take the 3rd dice and if it is even add it to the running total and chart and if odd subtract the total from the running total and plot this.  You will see that the resulting chart looks exactly like any stock chart or commodity chart or cryptocurrency chart  You can not forecast a random future from random pasts....",0

One of the lessons I picked early in life was to save maximum before marriage. And by God it was one of the best one. I used to save two thirds of salary at that time. I invested in a diversified MF. My patience was tested in year 2017 when my portfolio was down 30% but still I continued investing.

very informative video you have here there are several reasons why investment advisors and high net worth investors including major Banks are recognising the benefits of Bitcoin in their strategic  asset allocation. Key among them are portfolio diversification the upside potential versus other assets and future adoption potential with others like ETFs. (countries like Germany are taking the lead already). So far my trading experience has been awesome for years with the teachings of career trader Isaac Steward who has been my portfolio strategist. I started with little over 4BTC so far  i've accumulated more than 16BTC after taxes.,1

I understand the fact that tomorrow isn't promised to anyone but investing today is a hard thing to do because I have no idea of how and where to invest in,0
It's known that correction happens all the time but it is hard not to think of some of the worst cases for the market . I have met people who are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now. I'd say it's outrightly wrong to just sit back hodl and wait maybe incur some losses along the line that's a wrong mindset for an investo because as an investo finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making prof!ts should be the way of life. I have been more skillful than lucky to be honest also thanks to Chris MMcrypto who trained me as my initial invstment was multiplied by 5 In two months. For now you can only make a profit by trad!ng. For me I advise you can multiply the little you have with MMCrypto's stratgy. After getting in touch with Chris an anaIyst in the YT cryptospace who showed to utilize his stgy and so far net I0 BC  in 2 moths rad;ng with him. He is even on TIg  (  chrisjcrypto ) Nice day.,1

Venturing into the trading world without the help of a professional trader and expecting profits is like turning water into wine you would need a miracle that's why i trade with Magdalena Ferguson her skills set is exceptional.  Trading with an expert is really beneficial this will help you avoid losing your money on the trading market. I also trade with Mrs. Magdalena Ferguson and my portfolio has grown tremendously.  A wise person should know that in order to build success you should invest wisely and have proper knowledge or guide in the finance market.,1

I still see cryptocurrency as one of the best digital investment and I totally love the technology when it come to largest crypto asset bitcoin as a trader I have been able to understand that there are two sides when it come to crypto and everyone has their opinions when it come choosing side through am not kicking against Hold but I see it as old and odd strategy to make profit of the make as when the market goes bearish  investors/trader loses their investment which is always painful when you can take advantage of the market by involving in day trading or copying trade alert from professional trader that understand the market and use strategy to generate signal daily to make profit goes to your portfolio as I been doing. I'm with Reinvestment for the past 5 weeks now and have been able to trade to grow my initial 0.86btc to 7.34btc which will be rethink and I see that trading is better/profitable..... Reoinvestment daily signal are very accurate and always yield a great positive return on investment. Reinvestment can be contacted VIRTUALBTCINVESTCOM,1

Nice information. one of the best channel I now follow. I view cryptocurrency as one of the best digital investments and I totally love the technology when it comes to the largest crypto asset Bitcoin. As a trader I have been able to understand that there are two sides when it comes to growing crypto holding/trading and everyone has their opinions when it comes to choosing sides. It doesn't take a genius to know that the top 98 Bitcoin wallets have been accumulating so many Bitcoins in the last month while the little guys panic and sell they'll buy and take it cheap. Causing a supply shock and prices will skyrocket eventually. I'd say it's outrightly wrong to just sit back hold and wait maybe incure some losses along the line you can easily get to him the tag above my comment.  That's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins making profits should be the way of life. I started with 2 BTC and I have accumulated over 13 BTC now Through EDSlGNALS guild.,0

The best way to find growth stocks  key features to keep in mind is as follows: 1. Ensure gross margins are greater than 50% 2. Ensure P/E ratio is less than 100 3. Buy companies that are PROFITABLE very important irrespective of sector. 4. Debt to equity ratio is less than 30% 5. Current ratio is above 1 6. and a Float under 100 million   One stock that fits the bill is FLGT (Fulgent),0

The best -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I'm in California I bought a vehicle but in my shopping I had 12 hard inquiries done in a one month period I have heard (and I can't remember where) that in Ca. if you BUY a vehicle within 30 days of the first inquiry that any inquiries within that 30 day period would be combined into ONE inquiry. But this has not been changed on my reports which is giving me headache along side collections charge offs &amp;amp; tax liens but few weeks ago I read about  EXTREMETOPPERS.COM from an article created from 2019 by a UK blogger. They didn't only delete all negative items that's giving me headache they also raise by score by 265pts in under 3 weeks using these organization,1
So basically I just watched the video and I want to give a quick a heads up to my fellow Muslims: there are certain criterias and the ETF has to be Sharia conform (no drugs alcohol porn industry etc). The MSCI world would be the most popular and profitable for beginners but there are some haram Fonds in it and your money would come from a haram income and everything you buy would consequently loose Barakah so it is a little tricky for us but def possible I recommend this YouTuber (Im gonna link it I forgot his name) his channel is all about halal investing also Id recommend the MSCI World Islamic :),0

NFT is hilarious as people are just copying this selling merch whatever you name it in China they don't give a care in the world about your digital ownership and you have no legal means by which you could take this further with the CCP. My partner was involved with a few cases where startups raising funds did not even get off the ground. Chinese had someone acting as huge investors show interest in staking a massive investment but needed samples. Chinese just reproduced it and sold it. These startups had no recourse to take it further and CCP did not respond even when pursued through the support of Political officials.,0
That invisible credit problem was what I ran into when I tried to buy my first car. Partner that with a parent with zero financial knowledge (who had to co-sign the loan so I could get the car) and I walked away with the worst ever in history interest rate on a junk car from some sketchy dealership. I basically bought 1 1/2 cars buy the time I paid off the car I was in the dumps via credit owed $44k  in card debts and 97k in student loans and really couldnt afford anymore Tried Lexington law a while back and that was just a mistake My cousin referred me to ThespacehackersCom Im intrigued by their honesty and service,1

Ive always admired your content buddy top coins continue to experience slight dip though you may have noticed their price movement has hugely been influenced by the btc chart a lot of non crypto asset holders continue to raise their voice towards the dangers involved in indulging on crypto currencies and its business in general saying that the market would soon be fully regulated and prices drop I find that hilarious though. Crypto currency for one has come to stay it is our present and our future in a long run I perceive the fears of non holders that it becomes too late to hoLD certain assets which might be a challenge whilst hodling but is not the same when you trade crypto asset; plus from positive experience Ive seen that trading under the right strategy offers far bigger gains than hodling and waiting for price rises. I'm not really an expert though but Ive been undergoing high trade sessions using signals from trade expert ReAlSoUrCeInVeStMeNtOrG . His signals has been the most accurate  currently got about 8btc since trading with his signals. Strictly for crypto concerns realsourceinvestmentOrg can be reached through wed.,1

Bitcoins price action has been fluctuating throughout the past few days and weeks with bulls and bears both reaching a clear impasse the aggregated cryptocurrency market has been following in Btcoins lead and is struggling to garner any decisive momentum. One analyst is now noting that BTC has been holding above a key macro level throughout the past few months.

<If there is one thing I have learned in recent months it is to remain calm especially when it comes to investments in cryptocurrencies. Learn not to sell in a panic when everything goes down and not to buy in euphoria when everything goes up. I advise y'all to forget predictions and start making a good profit now because future valuations are all speculations and guesses. The market is very unstable and you can't tell if it's going bearish or bullish. While myself and others are trading without fear of making a loss others are being patient for the price to skyrocket. It all depends on the pattern you follow. I was able to make 7 BTC from 2.1 BTC in only August from implementing trades with tips and info from David Allen Walters,0

"Important points made and it's all great in my opinion when it comes to the  mother of all coins < B  TC > B!tcoin is getting interesting every day by day. Alt Xrp Link are still lucrative in the market. In this case the Majority are finding it difficult on which coin to HODL better. Right now bitcoin it's in the greatest shape and we are all expecting more of it I'm currently a HODler but still I'm using a working system that provides me 80% correct signal which helps me increases my portfolio now I bother less about the speculation of the market."" I'm still winning by applying the same method in every trad e you can also become a winner today I think crypto is going to get more importance and acknowledgment in the future. BTC is the future doesnt mean we should just hold and not think of the negative effect it would put on you when it goes low than the entry price. Most newbies often undermine and most often neglect the importance of Technical analysis with regards to trading. Technical analysis overly predicts the movement of asset prices regardless of what is happening in the wider or broader market . so to be on a safer side i advise that we all follow a less talked about way which is trad!ng.

i think gold bitcoin and cash are essential for currencies not one over the other. like for example you want to buy a car cash for 50 grand its troublesome to deal with banks in order to withdraw that amount of money so u have the option to pay with gold or crypto since they have significantly more value. and yes you need cash to pay for groceries because the total cost is not worth the crypto value,0

<Good job Mate. Lately when asked for predictions about bitcoin a nd cryptos generally most experts on youtube and other media predictions are mostly generic with no specifics on the direction. Everyone seems to be guessing and getting even more confused about the future. The only constant thing I can say for sure is that the traders are actually earning good returns while HODlers are always concerned about what the future holds for bitcoin or if there is even a future at all. With the insight skills and experience of a trader like Elisa the sky is the limit. I came to this realization when I made a return on investment of 87% in my first month using her signals for my trades. Not to sound biased there are lots of GOOD traders out there but Elisa has been of immense assistance to me especially with her signals and strategies......,1

The cryptocurrency has a fresh record high for in three years last month as people increased their bids in hopes of making huge gain from the rise but as we can see now the market is very unstable  the truth is that you can always make more profit from tradn rather than just hodlin and waiting for the price of BTC to skyrocket . Indeed its a tough decision for both old and newbies whose intensions are just to hodl and sell but rather the potentials of tradn Btc would allow you grow your Btc not minding the present price chart and also saving your ass from any future deep that may occur . I started tradn with 101expunge since late last year and till date have made over 14 Btc even with the ups and downs since the journey . With 101expunge help I no longer have to worry about the rise and dip of Bitcoin.,1

I advise y'all to forget predictions and start making a good profit now because future valuations are all speculations and guesses.The market is very unstable and you can't tell if it's going bearish or bullish.While myself and others are tradn without fear of making a loss others are being patient for the price to skyrocket. It all depends on the pattern you follow. I was able to make 7b TC in just July from implementing tradess with tips and info from Nelson hui.,1

Very detailed and precise video you put up mate i love it contentsits funny how some folks out there still haven't accepted the fact that cryptocurrencies continues to reshape the world globally Its hard for anyone going against it these days though from a trader's perspective i feel we really need more experts in the field updating newbies/lnvestor on how  the community works lately the price of BTC has been fluctuating which means the market is currently open and you cant tell if it is going to bearish or bullish  this uncertainty pushes most traders away and forces investors to holdi'd say it's outrightly wrong to just sit back and wait maybe incure some losses along the line that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stock up more coins should be our ultimate goal thereby making prof!ts it all depends on the pattern with which you trade and also the source of your signals. i started with 2 BTC and I have accumulated over 13 BTC in just  4weeks with the right trading strategy given to me by an expert trader Metro kelvin. His methods are top notch and profitable and he can be contacted easily on instagram [ kelvin1uptrades ]  on  insta for Crypto related concern,1

Hi Ali straight after watching this video I made a junior account on Vanguard (as I am 17) and tried to invest in the FTSE 100 and S&P 500. I have a part-time job so plan to invest around 200 to begin with but the website is saying there is a 500 minimum investment PER index fund. Is this a set rule for every online investment program? What should I do wait until I have 500 to invest or is there another way to invest on Vanguard without the minimum investment? Any feedback would be really appreciated! :),1
Spend 5 BTC or something lol... okay 59k a pc,1
Very helpful information you have coupled up in your video already subscribed to your channel. Most people will misunderstand what you highlighted in your video and equally the advantage they have to learn about cryptocurrency at its early stage. I count myself lucky to know crypto at this current era and to also witness the transformation blockchain is bringing to the world economy and with that effect if you are not holding as many bitcoin as possible you are simply missing up on the long run. I have been an investor of bitcoin since 2017 I buy into the fuzz during the bull run and I was holding because I don't understand how the market work. During the dip I was worried because the price I bought it with and the current price are two different things entirely and so I decided to look for a mentor who will enlighten me about trading and how I can hold more bitcoin. Luckily for me I met Mr FRANK who is a pro trader. he made me understand the crypto market and how he can help me to gain more bitcoin. I started implementing his strategies and the first month I gained up to 300% profit. I was so amazed and finally told myself that yes I have gotten a trader to help me out when it comes to crypto trading. Now I am growing my portfolio daily with him and I surely know that there are so many people currently into such situations who are looking to change their portfolio status worry no more because your portfolio status can be changed if you take action today by contacting FRANK on JOEINVESTMEN on !G ) and surely your portfolio status will be very well organized again.,1

The trading system is a set of certain algorithms trading instructions--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------and action of the trader on the basis of the technical analysis. In each trading system the conditions for entry/exit time intervals money management and risk management are clearly defined. Trading systems allow you to limit the factor of emotional influence on decision-making as well as to give the trade a certain degree of systemic character. I have been trading forex for 6 months now and never have! regretted going into it my only regret is not going through the right way as I lost a lot before l was directed to the best trading agent in the market PARAGONHACKCOM  grew my account drastically with my initial investment of $4500 to $32000 in a week.,1

Wow extremely terrible information on the environmental impact. It isn't 'some' it's MASSIVE there is a lot of data on this. The idea that traditional banking takes more when you compare the number of transactions is absolutely absurd. And the major currencies are still extremely environmentally damaging. Also the idea that we'll be getting that energy needed from renewables before the planet goes tits up is just a pipe dream.  We have a real problem right now cryptocurrency is making it much worse NFT hype is making that even worse than cryptocurrency was already. All for what? So those with money can keep getting richer.,1

love your video//<I think newbies usually undermine and neglect the importance of technical analysis with regards to trading. technical analysis overly predicted the movement of assets price regardless of what is happening in wider and broad market Essentially the procedure involves studying the the paths of particular asset movement in the past so as to establish a sustainable pattern that can be used to learn future movement of an asset. Doing technical analysis can be quiet different which is why newbies/traders neglect day trading their coin and stick to hodling which is very dangerous as when the market goes bearish or bullish  advice any newbies to buy the dip and to seek help from not just any traders but an establish trading expert with at least 96 % trade accuracy. Having Mr  Oscar Aldrich a well renowned trader. I dont have to bother if the prices are going bullish or bearish I still make consistent gains.,1

Stick with Eth and BTC as much as you can guys. If everyone sells when it starts to fall which at one point it will the dream may be lost because of it being too volatile for companies to get behind. just remember where it's going and don't be put off by short term fluctuations and don't facilitate this dream into becoming a nightmare .The coin-base thing will undoubtedly be replaced by another incident but it will always correct to higher until it's mooned naturally. Don't give up on it and start day trading it it will take too much time and concentration. Remember Eth is probably bitcoin part 2. It is quite unfortunate that the most popular word lately amongst crypto enthusiasts and traders alike is hodl. This concept of holding on for dear life in itself may not be a bad idea but why hold on to an investment instrument which could make you some money or make you very miserable tomorrow? Making a good profit off crypto is easy if and only if you can find the right entry point and exit point in your day trading. Someone I discovered that has tremendously helped me with this is R_e_a_l_s_o_u_r_c_e_i_n_v_e_s_t_m_e_n_t_O_r_g. He has a system which is so effective it amazes me. I have been using his signals and strategies and have turned out a very impressive profit over the last two months. I would suggest him for beginners and even more experienced traders who have a problem turning in a consistent profit. He can be contacted via website realsourceinvestmentorg   and please when you reach him tell him he was a blessing to my life and my family.,1
Crypto is the future trading crypto has become a lucrative way of making money,0
Cryptos ability to transfer instantly and accounts not be monitored heavily is why many have questions. Also why many criminals still use.  With that said honestly still think it's great that issue does not outweigh positives in similar way that criminals using regular money for there purposes does not stop us from using currency.  Only major problem in my opinion it does have is it being digital in nature.  Gives way to certain innate weakness that at higher levels could be exploited.,1

Thanks for continuous great videos I feel those who would allow the market dynamism to determine when to trade or not are either new in space in general or probably just naive the sphere have seen far worse times than this enlightened traders continue to make good use of the dip and pump even acquiring more equities towards trading sessions I'd say that more emphasis should be put into trading since it is way profitable than holding. Trading went smooth for me as I was able to raise over 7.1 BTC when I started at 2.9 BTC in just 2weeks implementing trades with signals and insights from Christoph Hoffmann Trading Signals and Strategy. I would advise you all to trade your asset rather than holding for a future for more information,0

How can I invest in Crypto,0
Wow Very Insightful content However personally I feel those who would allow the market dynamism determine when to trade or not are either new in crypto currency world in general or probably just naive crypto currencies have seen far worse times than this enlightened traders continue to make good use of the dip and pump even acquiring more equities towards trading sessions. I know doing Technical Analysis can be quite difficult which is why most newbies/ traders neglect day trading their coins and stick to Hodling which is very dangerous as when the market goes bearish they loose their investment. I'd strongly advise any newbie/ traders to buy the dip and seek help from not just any trader but an established trading expert with at least 89% trade accuracy. I underwent series of trading loses I'd best not talk about before I was introduced to trading analyst of Sir Chen R Zhang. My contact with him has been the Hallmark of this year for me under his careful guide and his signal service I've been able to recover my losses and even grow my trading portfolio massively from 1.2 btc to 6.4 btc in just 5 weeks. I will advice traders especially newbies to have orientation of trading before they involve in it. sir Chen R Zhang makes you learn daily while you make profit with his signals.

Hi Brian! Do you use any other (digital) crypto wallet?  Thank you!,1
NoNo No.... Paper money does not have value because the government says so.

Theses are the reasons a US dollar is worth more than a Jamaican dollar. Dah! Economics 101. Exchanges recognize the cryptocurrencies for one reason and one reason alone....TO MAKE MONEY OFF THE TRADING. That's it.,0

Success is dependent on the action or steps you take to achieve it. Show me a man who doesn't have an investment and I will tell you how soon he'll go broke.

WelI just noticed that trading is risking of money unnecessarily but investing in a profitable platform is very secure a kind of because if the crypto currency falls the loss is for the company only and your profits still standard without loss but *jasonmaddison2020* doesn't think about that nor withhold your dime for any reasons learn to always make a right choice investing.,1
Hello! I would like to ask you a question regarding fees. In your video you are saying that on decentralized exchanges the fees are pretty low. However from what I know the fees on the Ethereum blockchain are astronomical. So using one of their DEXes like Uniswap can mean huuuge fees. If the fees are truly low as you say in what circumstances are they low? Because I have not had a single transaction on Ethereum chain that would be cheap.,1
"Thank you for your video. Who else saw the Bitcoin all time high. I will advice traders especially newbies to have orientation of trading before they get involved in it because the crypto market has been unstable forget predictions and start making a good profit now because future valuations are all speculations and guesses. when news gets bearish start buying.

As in l can't seem to place a take profit order after l already have a stop-loss order in already for the full amount? Also if l wanted to just take my profits as l go up with a long order and not touch the principle amount which l have placed as a stop loss and my buy-in level can l do that as in I goes up 50 and l just do a take profit for 50 with the stop loss still there.

Greeting everyone!!! Staying calm through the daily market price changes isn't an easy feeling to bottle in With the current price I will advise investors to trade before the bull run as I still strongly believe BTC is going to enter the $70kSD record before year ending although that's my personal opinion. A lot of my friends who are holders are currently going crazy over the sudden drop in price and a follow up rise. Firstly you aren't supposed to be emotionally entangled with the market charts / price. This is a good realization I worked towards correcting early last year so it was never second-guessing when an opportunity as crypto trading came my way. With much energy channeled into trading bit coin daiIy with the guide of the experts Realsourceinvestmentdotorg my portfolio went from approximate 3.2Bit coin to 18.4Bitcoin within a year. I will always suggest to newbies or old holders Trade with an expert! It is truly easy only requires your time and guide with a mentor like them. You can reach them through web     Real Source InvestmentOrg,1

<Zooming out on the longer-term market may put bitcoins current price difficulties in perspective but it offers little help in predicting its future trajectory. Analysts remain divided over whether this is the end of a so-called dead cat bounce within a bear market or if it is just a blip on the way to new all-time highs in 2021. Either way the price fluctuations are to be expected that is why it is reasonable to trade with the guidance of an expert. Since July till now I have accumulated up to 12 BTC with exclusive tips from Harold,0
Analysts say Bitcoin price needed to slow down in order to maintain the bullish momentum needed for the next leg up. Bitcoins parabolic increase well above its previous all-time-high has many experiencing dj vu from 2017 and a number of analysts are concerned the market is overdue for a sizeable correction. On Jan. 8 With Bitcoin (BTC) price reached a new all-time high at $4I94O and this weeks 28% collapse to $3IO76 had professional and retail investors afraid that a strong trend reversal was in the making. As long as the price continues to stay above these the chances are that we will see higher highs for the Bitcoin price. I will advise every investor to keep buying and accumulating or better still if you want to make more profit with what you already have get a Great Mentor and coach like mine to guide you through I have made over 9 Btc profit since the October Rally not from buying at dips but from day trading thanks to my mentor @MOORE256 on Telegram for always helping me stay ahead of this market Reach out and you'll be glad you did,1

It all depends on the pattern you follow.I was able to make 11 bTC in just August from implementin trdess with tips and info from  David Wong,1
wonderful lessons for new trader like myself. Great details and modeling.some persons will definitely be kicking themselves in regret for missing the opportunity to invest in bitcoin. Bitcoin is pretty much a genius Idea no more printing of money ,1

&lt;I must say. Bitcoins price action has been fluctuating throughout the past few days and weeks with bulls and bears both reaching a clear impasse the aggregated cryptocurrency market has been following in Btcoins lead and is struggling to garner any decisive momentum. One analyst is now noting that BTC has been holding above a key macro level throughout the past few months. He believes that the recent consolidation above this level bodes well for its near-term outlook and could indicate that significantly further upside is imminent in the weeks and months ahead. Tips like this are why its advisable for investors and newbies to trade with the help of pro traders like R-e-a-l-s-o-u-r-c-e-i--n-v-e-s-t-m-e-n-t-o-r-g they is always one step ahead of other traders they fully monitored all my trades to avoid me making mistakes and losing my money. My earnings have increased drastically from 1.01 BTC to 9.700 BTC in just 4 weeks using their strategy. You can easily get hold of them for a profitable system @ realsourceinvestmentOrg,1

"This was quite interesting to watch! In my opinion I think it's quite possible that to some degree the prices of cryptocurrencies was ""brought"" down recently to give institutional buyers a chance to buy at lower prices these institutions aren't buying Bitcoin because they think the dollar price will stay at these levels. Yes it's likely that around the end of this year there might be some kind of big (BTC) move higher but whether prices in dollars will then drop 85% is not clear. By the end of the year a lot of fiat printing will have occurred and prices of goods may be beginning to rise faster. Thoughts?",0

I've been studying crypto for over two years on a daily almost obsessive basis. And I am by no means an expert because there is no way to keep up with it all.  You really really need to do your homework before investing.  You'll make mistakes.  Everyone does but you'll learn from them.  I suggest: take it slow be cautious try things out and do not get sucked into hyped up coins ICOs and projects.  There are a lot of hucksters in this space who will take advantage of your noob status so beware.  My diligence has paid off for me and it will for you too.,0
Trading has not been going well with me I have invested a lot of time and failed I traded on my own but each time I keep losing money I don't have good strategies towards the market.,1

You can invest in individual stocks providing you do your due diligence on the company and continue to learn and expand your financial education. It all comes down to each individuals financial literally but of course beginners should start with investing in index funds but I believe no one should simply stop at investing in index funds as with financial education comes the ability to spot sound opportunities  with your mind rather than opportunities most miss by trying to find opportunities with their eyes.,1

Very detailed and precise video you put up mate i love it contentsits funny how some folks out there still haven't accepted the fact that cryptocurrencies continues to reshape the world globally Its hard for anyone going against it these days though from a trader's perspective i feel we really need more experts in the field updating newbies/lnvestor on how  the community works lately the price of BTC has been fluctuating which means the market is currently open and you cant tell if it is going to bearish or bullish  this uncertainty pushes most traders away and forces investors to holdi'd say it's outrightly wrong to just sit back and wait maybe incure some losses along the line that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stock up more coins should be our ultimate goal thereby making prof!ts it all depends on the pattern with which you trade and also the source of your signals. i started with 2 BTC and I have accumulated over 13 BTC in just  4weeks with the right trading strategy given to me by an expert trader Metro kelvin. His methods are top notch and profitable and he can be contacted easily on instagram [ kelvin1uptrades ]  on  insta for Crypto related concern .,1

In each trading system the conditions for entry/exit time intervals money management and risk management are clearly defined. Trading systems allow you to limit the factor of emotional influence on decision-making as well as to give the trade a certain degree of systemic character.

I'm 44 years old married 11 years and we have 2 children. First four years of our marriage we had 3 cars stolen. Then a car that was flooded a few years later then our rented house and another car flooded a couple years after that (we had to swim out of our house) . I've never made nore than $20/hr in my life. In 2015 we were $110K in debt. Student loans car and credit cards. Now in 2019 we are $50K in debt with only student loans and our car. We've been watching EVERY penny. In the past 4 years we've cut out $60K of debt. I'll be 45 when we are able to buy our first house and our children will be teenagers such is sad but we will not have any other debt. What makes me happy is that our children are going through this struggle with us. When they are old enough to be our in the world they will already know what my wife and I have been learning for the past 11 years and am Indriq Jason doesn't want the stress for us he comes online and introduce us to THESPACEHACKERSCOM no much talk i got a perfect credit score combination with wife also got 10BTC,1

I watch a lot of YouTube videos and see a lot of traders earning massively and then I start to wonder what I could possibly be doing wrong because Ive been trading for a couple of months and every trading attempt seems to be red never have I seen a green day.

Great Material!! thanks bro god bless you!!,0
this was a very good video and has helped me decide that investing in the stock market isn't as risky as i thought and as long as I don't sell short i will not actually lose money. but actually leaving my money in my savings accounts actually loses me money over time in its value and buying power. But don't really try and time the market just buy stocks as a way to save rather than just looking to get rich quick.    also by buying shares I'm less likely to dip into my savings than i would by having that money in a safe or in an isa.  I recently started investing in bitcoin but I think I'm going to start putting money into both and hopefully ill stop wasting my savings and actually grow my money over time and actually keep some savings. I've noticed i dip into my savings so much that i don't actually have hardly anything left. The fees of buying and selling will actually make me less likely to dip in to buy something nice impulsively than an instant transfer that i can do with my isa.,1

Like most currencies Bitcoin's price changes every day. The only difference is that the bitcoin price varies on a much larger scale than local currencies. While there are many other factors such as supply and demand that can affect Bitcoin value other cryptocurrencies and many others can be used as a basic model and many of these factors cannot be predicted so the remaining factors can be examined manually. It can be used to get a fair idea of ??prices and where investments can be made. Bitcoin is still young and many sources say it will stay here. Therefore it might be a good idea to invest in the same. It may be helpful to speak to a professional in case you have questions Burwell Coleman runs a training program for amateur investors who don't understand how Trading Bitcoin works. I contacted him and he told me the price for his program (no upfront payment) we started working he gave me guides on what to do I started trading on the same day under his guidance it was a bit complicated but after 3 days I got better I continued with him for 3 weeks I earned a total of $ 28000 and paid him coming down to the world and always ready to teach so contact them on telegram CREDITREPAIRPORT  for any crypto related inquiries you may have for..,1

I put it back and traded with her again and now I'm rounding up close to a million. Delayed gratification always pays off,1
