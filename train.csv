Hello I'm new to Biticon and crypto trade and I have been making huge losses but I recently see a lot of people earning from it. Can someone please tell me what i'm doing wrong,0
Please do a whole breakdown on how to get into this,0
First,0
Can you tell me how I can trade? I've heard so much about cryptocurrency (bitcoin in particular)!?,1
If you're talking about cryptocurencies the best way for that is just to start mining or buying recently listed altcoins then build from there,0
It was awesome thankyou very very much ,0
Thanks Ali this is so helpful <3,1
What index to invest in?,0

My husband and I have been able to be minimal conscious in spending saving and investing wisely I now earn every week. You're such a blessing to this generation. we all love you,1
bit of crypto currency at the present time! Although i fancy trading over hodling because of its productivity and extra information on crypto by and large. Overtime,1
With the current increase in the market I see Cryptocurrency as ultimately becoming a reserve currency for banks  playing much the same role as gold did in the early days of banking . Banks could issue digital cash with greater anonymity and lighter weight  more efficient transactions,0
Would love an updated video on your gains/ losses hiccups and overall experience in the 2+ yrs,0
I have lost so much through investing cause I was new and didn't meet the right one to invest with. I was at the verge of quilting till I was introduced to ELITECAPITALLIMITED and my story changed with the 72k..,1

<I must say. Bitcoins price action has been fluctuating throughout the past few days and weeks with bulls and bears both reaching a clear impasse the aggregated cryptocurrency market has been following in Btcoins lead and is struggling to garner any decisive momentum. One analyst is now noting that BTC has been holding above a key macro level throughout the past few months. He believes that the recent consolidation above this level bodes well for its near-term outlook and could indicate that significantly further upside is imminent in the weeks and months ahead. Tips like this are why its advisable for investors and newbies to trade with the help of pro traders like mr Chen lawrence. He is always one step ahead of other traders he fully monitored all my trades to avoid me making mistakes and losing my money. My earnings have increased drastically from 1.01 BTC to 9.700 BTC in just 4 weeks using his strategy. You can easily get hold of him for a profitable system on TE LE GRAM (@ chentradingi..,1
I'm 15. I will start investing. School is not working out for me (i just cant go to school). I got a pretty okay job $9/h. I will start with $100 every months in Voo. Work 5 is min walk from house. I will update in 5 years how everything is! (writing this down),1
I came here to learn how to invest after listening to a guy on radio talk about the importance of investing and how he made $420000 in 4 months from $140k somehow this video has helped shed light on some things but I still am confused I'm a newbie and I'm open to ideas on how to invest for retirement...,1

"Crypto currency is litteraly the Matrix man slaving away doing the bidding of program's and computers instead of the other way around. This would be obvious to anyone but the main goal of today is money money and more money crypto currency has all the sense of the Tulip frenzy of the 18 th century or the Bennie Baby craze of our times but how does 50 cents phrase it "" Get Money or Die Trying"" pretty much explains our current financial markets.",0

<.<Bitcoin has seen some incredible strength throughout the past couple of weeks with the confluence of a strong market structure and an undercurrent of positive developments both helping to drive it higher. Stick with BTC/ETH/SHIBA INU as much as you can guys just remember where it's going and don't facilitate this dream into becoming a nightmare. This strength has led BTC above $65k  which is proving to be a crucial resistance level for the cryptocurrency. Most newbies usually undermine and neglect the importance of technical analysis with regards to trading. I advise any newbies/traders to buy the dip for traders who are still wondering to enter the market or old time traders who are holders to seek help from not just any trader but an established trading expert with at least 96% trade accuracy. I underwent series of trading loses I'd best not talk about before I was introduced to trading analyst Mr Paulson Dmitriev. My contact with him has been the Pinnacle of this year for me Under his careful guide and his signal service I've been able to recover my losses and even grow my trading portfolio massively from 1.3 BTC to 8 BTC in just 5 weeks. I will advice traders esp newbies to have orientation of trading before they involve in it. Mr Paulson 's makes you learn daily while you make profit with his signals Here his official GMail paulsondmitriev @ gmail com  for more information or for financial advice regarding crypto investment>/////////////-///////////,1
Losing a job affects the credit score. I was out of work for three years. I couldn't pay my bills. Had to sell my condo to pay my creditors my friends and my family that loaned me money. I've been employed three years now and bought another condo two years ago but my credit score still bites. DO NOT OVERCHARGE!! Several of my accounts were closed by the credit card companies. It's impossible to know what will happen today or tomorrow because I believed my credit will remain the same forever after several credit repair companies failed but on Youtube here I got recommended to  I can't say it all. but these guys saved my life and gave my dead credit a new life. they're highly recommended  R-E-A-L-S-O-U-R-C-E-I-N-V-E-S-T-M-E-N-T-O-R-G,1

Hi everyone! And sorry for a stupid question but Im super new to crypto and escpecially trading. So Ive watched this video a lot of times and trying to set the ATR to calculate the stop loss for my trade but for some reason Im getting some ridiculous atr numbers that vary from time to time but right at the moment its giving me the following:  5.307  And sometimes that number has been closer to 10 000 as well.. So Im a bit confused over this.   And yes Ive really chosen the atr on the technical indicator.  In my opinion the number prob should be somewhere around that 3000 like in this video.  Any idea where the problem may be?  Cheers!!,1

hi mate good video i been watching it a lot over and over among others to learn. i decided to try my hand and trading etc as..why not i joined up on a  few platforms etc and im actually trading..but only with the victual account so far just to see how i fair and im doing fine..i wanted to ask you some thing  i have a few different platforms open at the same time and im watching what each different one does and i noticed even though they seem to be somewhat synced  the price on say for example bitcoin varies quite a lot between them? why is that? for example i like etoro to use in general but i find the graph is crap so i been watching some other on other platforms as they are really good..like binance's graph is good but there is a big gap between the 2 and i even noticed on etoro say if the the price for bitcoin reads  35598.00 when i got to lock in a trade ti locks it in at 35860.00...> i tested this a lot and it does it every time? what up with that.  any help would be great before i put real money in to it,0

Cryptocurrency movements are very volatile and highly uncertain. Although the numbers are very encouraging  as an active stock trader for the last 3 decades I feel that the Equity and the Commodity Market instruments are well equipped with proper hedging tools to help you make the same amount of money with less risk. Food for thought.,0

my brother in law's best friend went in on btc when it was only 60$ each.  He was traveling and his hotel room got ransacked..  he changed rooms and that room got ransacked also.   He changed to another hotel and the next morning a girl dressed like an employee knocked on the door when he opened it a big dude came in  demanding the private key to his wallet . he didnt give it up but the guy beat him bad while the girl stood lookout.    He hasnt traveled since.,1
Thank you for your video didnt realize there was so much out there. I invested about a month ago around $200 USD of disposable income and have seen it grow to about $800 so a $600 profit. I would suggest everyone get involved and research like you said start off with $10 and learn how it works ,1

Nice workI advise you all to forget predictions and start making a good profit now because future valuations are all speculations and guesses.The market is very unstable and you can't tell if it's going bearish or bullish.While myself and others are tradn without fear of making a loss others are being patient for the price to skyrocket.

<very informative video you have here there are several reasons why investment advisors and high net worth investors including major Banks are recognizing the benefits of Bit coin in their strategic  asset allocation. Key among them are portfolio diversification the upside potential versus other assets and future adoption potential with others like ETFs. (countries like Germany are taking the lead already). So far my trading experience has been awesome for years with the teachings of career trader Cory Bill who has been my portfolio strategist. I started with little over nothing so far  I've accumulated more 24.3BTC..,1

The crypto market is as of now experiencing a bull run and a lot of novices believe this to be a chance to get in on the actionI think I'll permit others to hold the sack. This happens at whatever point something moons. I've seen with Bitcoin in 2018 in the silver market the oil market dwelling and shockingly about solitary stocks. When something moons like this! statements of regret you are too far to consider turning back. My urge to you is if you are expecting to go in the Crypto Market you should trade with a smart philosophy instead of buying Crypto holdin it to cause gain and thereafter to get disappointed by an unpreventable mishap down the middle a month. Strange year I have had the choice to make 13+BTC clinging to the rules and signs from Levi Lucas He runs program for monetary sponsor/fledglings who need understanding on how trading Bitcoin capacities to help them with utilizing the unusualness of the crypto market and moreover stack up more Crypto. You can without a very remarkable stretch get to Lucas on Google(VIRTUALBTCINVEST),1

<I must say. Bitcoins price action has been fluctuating throughout the past few days and weeks with bulls and bears both reaching a clear impasse the aggregated cryptocurrency market has been following in Btcoins lead and is struggling to garner any decisive momentum. One analyst is now noting that BTC has been holding above a key macro level throughout the past few months. He believes that the recent consolidation above this level bodes well for its near-term outlook and could indicate that significantly further upside is imminent in the weeks and months ahead. Tips like this are why its advisable for investors and newbies to trade with the help of pro traders like mr Chen lawrence. He is always one step ahead of other traders he fully monitored all my trades to avoid me making mistakes and losing my money. My earnings have increased drastically from 1.01 BTC to 9.700 BTC in just 4 weeks using his strategy. You can easily get hold of him for a profitable system on TE LE GRAM (@ chentrading1.,1

Wow Very Insightful content However personally I feel  those who would allow the market dynamism determine when to trade or not are either new in crypto currency world in general or probably just naive crypto currencies have seen far worse times than this enlightened traders continue to make good use of the dip and pump even acquiring more equities towards trading sessions. I know doing Technical Analysis can be quite difficult which is why most newbies/ traders neglect day trading their coins and stick to Hodling which is very dangerous as when the market goes bearish they loose their investment. I'd strongly advise any newbie/ traders to buy the dip and seek help from not just any trader but an established trading expert with at least 89% trade accuracy. I underwent series of trading loses I'd best not talk about before I was introduced to trading analyst of Sir Chen R Zhang. My contact with him has been the Hallmark of this year for me under his careful guide and his signal service I've been able to recover my losses and even grow my trading portfolio massively from 1.2 btc to 6.4 btc in just 5 weeks. I will advice traders especially newbies to have orientation of trading before they involve in it. sir Chen R Zhang makes you learn daily while you make profit with his signals.

I admire the efforts u put in your videos mate. Bitcoin's price action has been fluctuation throughout the past few days and weeks with bulls and bears both reaching a clear impasse the aggregated cryptocurrency market has been following in Bitcoin's lead and is struggling to garner any decisive momentum. One analyst is now noting that BTC has been holding above a key macro level throughout the past few months. He believes that the recent consolidation above this level bodes well for its near-term outlook and could indicate that significantly further upside is imminent in the weeks and months ahead. Tips like this  it's advisable for investors and newbies to trade with the help of pro traders like Expert Mrs Abigail Johnson . She's always onestep ahead of other traders she fully monitored all my trades to avoid me making mistakes and losing my money. My earnings have increased drastically from 1BTC to 9.2BTC in just 3weeks using her strategy. You can easily reach Expert Mrs Abigail Johnson +447881600320,1

Such an informative video. Everyone should know this; life without investing could be really difficult I've told a lot of people I come across even here on YouTube find a passive income grow your money live frugal. Remember you can't live a million lifestyle working and depending on others. I am still searching for a millionaire that made his or her millions from saving in the bank or on salaries. Investing has been the marginal gap between the poor and the rich. The Rich invest more and spend less while the poor does the opposite.,0

<Amazing content From a technical standpoint the biggest challenges investors face can range from controlling the impulsiveness to the frailty of compulsion Most newbies and investors often undermine and neglect the importance of technical analysis to trading Technical analysis overly predicts the movement of asset prices regardless of what is happening in the broad market. In essence the process involves studying the paths of a particular asset movement in the past to create a sustainable pattern that can be used to predict the future movement of the asset. It takes a lot of time to do this Why do I find expert opinion in retail has always been a guide to me and I've enjoyed the signaling service of some with some losses until I've started copying trade notifications from Mr. Kelvin Anderson to trades in these past 6 weeks and I've seen differences in my portfolio. I started with 2 BTC and I have accumulated over 14.btc He is an expert trader with a high trading accuracy he can be reached on INSTAGRAM. (Kelvin1uptrades),1
Awesome and very insightful updates Well i will also say this here... Even as the world still experience slow recovery in terms of economic meltdown due to the recent Covid-19 outbreak it is best advised to find another alternative to make good income. For me cryptocurrency has been one of the best alternative mostly Bitcoin as the leading asset. Involving in day trading backed with a very accurate signals and strategy is the best way to grow a very strong portfolio when it comes to bitcoin trading properly guided by a pro trader. At this stage i still encourage traders to buy and also with the little you hold it is much advisable to find a better working strategy to build a strong portfolio ahead of the up-rise This of course is a good time for me and its been going on for months now because i have been trading with Miss Caroline daily signals which has proven to be very profitable several times and have been using since the bear market with which have been able to make at least 6.8 BTC in profit every month when i trade actively. Caroline's daily signals are very accurate and always yields a great positive return on investment and is always available to give a helping hand She can be reach on Telegram @carolinenyman for inquiries into profitable trading system,1

Crypto currencies has been blazing a few indications of solidarity all through the previous few days with bulls being in full control of their price action as they aim at pushing general prices over the resistance level.. General bullish moves has being productive to hodlers and traders the same with everybody anxious to get a bit of crypto currency at the present time! Although i fancy trading over hodling because of its productivity and extra information on crypto by and large. Overtime i have used lots of signal service and guide from experts to assist with trading one of those experts has been central to most of the trading successes i have enjoyed..

I have been trading for about 6 months now and just about every trade backfires and slaps me in my face. Nearly impossible for me to catch more than a few points  . I try to do top down analysis but it doesn't work for me . I say to myself clearly I'm in the 90% that lose money so I open a demo account do my analysis then take the opposite of what I would normally take and get the same result. I'm starting to feel hopeless any advice for a struggling trader?,0
what is this PETN token does anyone knows about it ?,0
I appreciate your approach to teaching. I've been quite unsure about investing in this current market and at the same time I feel it's the best time to get started on the market heard some guy speaking of making over $300k from a $90k capital since the pandemic and I'm driven to ask what skillset and strategy can generate such profit thanks to Jason Brown for showing me how to invest and trade as a pro. ,1

Who knew REALSOURCEINVESTMENT. ORG would be my break through,1
The information shared here is very helpful and important there are several reasons why investment advisors and high net worth investors including major Banks are recognising the benefits of Bitcoin in their strategic  asset allocation. Key among them are portfolio diversification the upside potential versus other assets and future adoption potential with others like ETFs. (countries like Germany are taking the lead already). So far my trading experience has been awesome for years with the teachings of career trader Mica Sanchez who has been my portfolio strategist. I started with little over 0.9BTC so far  i've accumulated more than 6. 5BTC after taxes,1

No its not a receipt. It represents an amount of (hopefully important and worthwhile) work that has been done. If that work produced resources and products (and particularly high tech products) the currency is strong if that work doesnt feed fix enhance or cure the currency becomes weak. Crypto currency is a cardboard box capital because it doesnt have the standard of being represented by a product resource or solution. Because no work is accomplished yet people make money based on speculation that more people are going to buy in crypto is undoubtably going to create poverty due to scarcity because no products are being made,0

I admire the efforts u put in your videos mate digital currencies continues to  reshape the world globally its hard for for anyone going against them these days though from a trader's perspective i feel we really need more experts in the field updating newbies on how the community works.  crypto currencies are gradually moving towards something big and the price surge over the past few months is just the beginning of greater things to come.  lots of persons are skeptical on when to buy-in the market and whether it isn't too late to buy an asset when you're holding it could be but when trading its never too late to buy.  a trader with the right strategy and indicators earns big regardless of market price (bulls or bears).  i trade using signals from trade expert Hana  Trading Signals with is guide and signal service l've made over $ 450k worth of crypto assets over some months.

What is DP (Digital Point)  DP is a peer-to-peer Internet currency that enables instant and easy cost payments to anyone in the world. DP is an open source of global payment network that is fully decentralized without any central authorities. The extremely fast and high end servers secures the network and empowers individuals to control their own finances. DP features faster transaction confirmation times and improved storage efficiency than the leading math-based currency.  DP is a digital unit that is created through a process called Buying. Just like the barcodes of several items on the bill of your shopping list each digital DP is unique. The terms DP and DP are absolutely same as per conditions. DP is the dividend unit of the Pearlvine system. Neither it is possible to intrude into the system of Pearlvine system nor anyone can extract DP outside of the system from any source for its various purposes.  Unlike the paper money issued by governments theres a finite number of DP ensuring that they cannot be affected by inflation and impossible to produce counterfeits. Just because the Virtual currencies are not tied to any particular country or central bank the value of the DP depends on factors such as ability to use demand and supply.  After joining DP users become part of a global network of millions of DP buyers who are able to choose among different ways to use their DPs. You can buy DP and can gain a lot of benefits from its value. In updates you will be able to make payments and transfer money to and any part of the world from any corner of this planet having internet networks.  DPs new and unique wallet string will set a new industry standard by storing KYC (Know your customer) information it will work 24x7 and is tailored to customer and merchant needs for their various personal chores.  With its finite number of 100 billion DP DP is also the biggest reserve currency worldwide DP is a medium of exchange like normal currencies such as USD but designed for the purpose of exchanging digital information through a process made possible by certain principles. These principles are used to secure the transactions and to control the creation of new DP i.e. often referred to as DP.  In easy words virtual currency is electrically converted into lines of code with monetary value. In the simplest of forms DP is a digital number.,1

TThe trading system is a set of certain algorithms trading instructions and action of the trader on the basis of the technical analysis. In each trading system the conditions for entry/exit time intervals money management and risk management are clearly defined. Trading systems allow you to limit the factor of emotional influence on decision-making as well as to give the trade a certain degree of systemic character. I have been trading forex for 6 months now and never have! regretted going into it my only regret is not going through the right way as I lost a lot before l was directed to the best trading agent in the market REALSOURCEINVESTMENTORG grew my account drastically with my initial investment of $4500 to $32000 in a week.,1

I was interested in buying a house last November. I had to fix my Bitcoin investment plan and I didnt prequalify to buy till March. My first house I offered was rejected and I didnt find a great deal till June and closed July 31st. It takes time and stressful and just a roller coaster ride! Moving and furnishing be prepared to drop 3-5 thousand $$$ just like that. Phew ... its expensive buying a house but its worth it if you do it wisely! Oh and it helps to have a good realtor thats on your side and is positive. Same goes for the mortgage lender. I dropped my first mortgage lender because he made me feel like it was hopeless to fix my investment plan to qualify. He was like... even it you pay this or that off you still may not qualify. I dropped him and the other broker was like... here what you need to do and get done and they followed up on my progress . Stay away from nay sayers and find a team V I R T U A L B T C I N V E S T COM,1

Tesla said it had invested around $1.5 billion in bitcoin and expected to begin accepting payment for its cars and other products with it in the near future prompting a 9% jump in the electronic currency. Tesla said in a filing the decision was part of its broad investment policy as a company and was aimed at diversifying and maximizing its returns on cash. It said it had invested an aggregate $1.5 billion in bitcoin under the changed policy and could &amp;quot;acquire and hold digital assets from -time to time or long-term&amp;quot;. Teslas investment is another sign that the cryptocurrency is gaining widespread traction as a type of investment.  Bitcoin still remains the Future of Finance I will advise every investor to keep buying and accumulating or better still if you want to make more profit with what you already have get a Great Mentor and teacher like mine (Mr. NATHAN HOWES) to guide you through I have made over 9Btc profit since the October Rally thanks to my mentor V-I-R-T-U-A-L-B-T-C-I-N-V-E-S-TCOM,1

Love this just some more tips for beginner investors:  1) Don't try and predict the market. There are people that get paid huge sums of money to do so for a living. They have inside information that you or I do not. Even then they are often wrong.  2)  Play the long game. On average you will make at least 8% per year on index funds like the S&P500 or FTSE 100  3) Don't be an emotional investor. Don't sell when the stock drops. Use numbers and data as your insight not your emotion.,0

<The crypto market has been unstable. People ask themselves if this is the right time to invest? before jumping into conclusion i think you should take a look at things first. BTC price fallen doesn't means analysts remain divided over whether it is entering a bear market or is just suffering a brief correction on the road to more record highs. Investors who bought early are still in profit despite the recent price crash and they also earn by trading. I'm still an investor but still I'm winning by applying the same method in every trade you can also become a winner today. We should follow the way of earning more regardless of the current market (bulls or bears) which is trading. Buy the Dip and Trade...I have made over 26 BTC profits not just by buying the dip but by implementing tradess with  signal's supplied by Mr. Toray Andrew. For inquiries into a profitable system you can easily get to toray on  as (@Torayandrew),1

How to invest when you know that you'll have to take education loans in near future? Should people invest if they have to go abroad for Masters/MBA? (Given that they have to take a loan of say USD 100k). You've been teaching about compounding but how should one plan their investments when they're about to be loaded with debt? Should a person invest now take out money later payback debt fast and then resume investing?,0

That was a really good breakdown! Regarding NFT: How useful they are really depends on what they represent. Yes the way they're used in the digital art sector without any actual ownership is more like making a donation to a creator. But NFTs could also be used to transfer actual ownership over something. An NFT could represent actual ownership of a song or a distribution license. Imagine this: Currently Spotify licenses a song from a label and pays them each time they play the song. With NFTs an artist could auction off the distribution rights to a song by minting a token and selling it. Spotify would then have to pay whom ever holds those rights (the token). And because it's a non-fungible token these rights could be sold and transferred to someone else who then receives the fees. And because these payments happen over the blockchain too Spotify wouldn't even have to know who actually owns the license. Who ever holds the song's token would receive the license fees There are many more similar applications like that,1

&lt;I must say. Bitcoins price action has been fluctuating throughout the past few days and weeks with bulls and bears both reaching a clear impasse the aggregated cryptocurrency market has been following in Btcoins lead and is struggling to garner any decisive momentum. One analyst is now noting that BTC has been holding above a key macro level throughout the past few months. He believes that the recent consolidation above this level bodes well for its near-term outlook and could indicate that significantly further upside is imminent in the weeks and months ahead. Tips like this are why its advisable for investors and newbies to trade with the help of pro traders like X-B-R-I-T-C-L-O-N-E-N-E-T  they is always one step ahead of other traders they fully monitored all my trades to avoid me making mistakes and losing my money. My earnings have increased drastically from 1.01 BTC to 9.700 BTC in just 4 weeks using their strategy. You can easily get hold of them for a profitable system @ *XBRITCLONENET*,1

"I invest in stocks instead of housing as housing is more likely to be affected by local government policy. For example rent controls or eviction bans or some other new regulation about affordable housing etc. The stock market is a global system to enforce a regulation that will affect publicly traded companies over the globe that could massively affect the value of my investments is unlikely to come into effect  Also the ""you will lose all your money in the stock market so buy a house instead"" is typical Indian parents comments ",0

I don't consider renting passive income unless you have professional property management. Most people who rent don't count their time and effort needed just to make a tiny return on their massive investment. For example you invest $599000 to buy a second home and rent it out for $3000 a month. Let assume you are cash flow positive on the property and you make $1000 a month or $12000 a year. What would your annualized return be? 2 percent on the entire amount. Now you can argue that your return is much higher since you only put down $120000 on the property. However you are on the hook for the full $600k regardless of what the future FMV of the house is. Furthermore people assume that their home will always appreciate in value however this is a false assumption you can make. In the best case you will gain some capital appreciation thanks to the central bank increasing the money supply however if inflation heats up you can see your property actually start to lose money in real terms.  This is because there is an inverse relationship between housing and nominal interest rates. The central bank will attempt to slow down inflation with higher interest rates and curb lending. We haven't seen inflation in a big way but we can see all the massive stimulus money that the government is pumping turn into inflation while taxes will be hiked to pay for all the COVID spending your best choice is to look into crpto and VIRTUALBTCINVESTCOM Its the video.,1

Most newbies fail simply because they don't understand how the market works in general or in particular how the market relates to stock/forex or currency pair they entering. If a retail trades doesn't grasp what the market makers are doing and when they are doing it the greatest strategy in the world will fall. For new traders the markets are like entering an F1 race before you've passed your drivers license test. One more advantage is the possibility to benefit from repetition. Without this type of strategy you probably won't know what worked or why it worked and even if you did it would be hard to repeat therefore for you need a perfect mentor to teach you perfectly to enable you invest and trade accurately on your own which i highly recommend you Mr Hercules He guides me with the exact time frame to trade and now I just received my first withdrawals of $30k in my bank account today I'm very happy my advice is for you to contact him he will guide you perfectly well and thank me later I guess this is a good way to show my heartfelt appreciation for literally breaking the chain of my financial debit when I needed it most you can contact him on his email   (elvishercules48@gmail.com),1

"Hello everyone Good day... love your video and analysis. Bitcoin recently posted what is widely described as a so-called ""blow-off top"" when it rallied to highs of $40000 before facing an instant rejection that sent it tumbling down to $30000. The support at this level was significant and has proven to be a strong base it has since rebounded off. As such the possibility of its latest leg higher being a bearish blow-off top appears to be invalid for the time being. I mean honestly if your only goal ""become a millionaire"" ur just begging to make a dumb decision and be disappointed...I think many will become millionaires in this current bull market but it's not the right mentality as holding can be very dangerous. As hard as it is trading Crypto is way more lucrative and is quite logical if you just study the charts and the support resistance and pay attention to what's going on I'm not a pro trader but I was lucky enough to make make 25BTC since last year following the instructions and signals from Mrs. Lauren Thomas. she runs program for investors/newbies who lack understanding on how trading Bitcoin and altcoins to help them utilize the volatility of the crypto market and also stack up more bitcoin.

Crypto investing is tough quite alright but not as difficult as it may seem if you follow the basic rules and don't love or get emotional with your coins. It is volatile and scary at times as things can fly up and down at extreme rates. If you are not careful then you risk massive losses. To ensure continuous profitability make sure you learn be careful and do not listen to stupid things most Crypto traders say on youtube and other forums as they are lots of speculators in the market who tell you XRP is going to moon or BTC is at its dip and a reversal is sure and you even lose more money holding on to coins because they said so. The truth from my personal experience is that trading daily is far safer and more profitable than HODling with so much uncertainty in the market. I have lost over 8 BTC value HODling for one year and have gained over 13 BTC in less than two months something I am sure is a daydream for most hodlers. You have to be careful though and be exceptionally good in your T.As reading the news and understanding the trend correctly. I would also like to stress is that if you aren't 100% sound in these you should make contact with someone with good experience and trade history to help you through. Someone I would highly recommend is James Long **(jameslong241 @ Gmail. com). His analysis is sound and his trade signals and strategies are some of the best out there to follow. He helped me recover my losses and make gains I find hard to believe.,1

Like most currencies Bitcoin's price changes every day. The only difference is that the bitcoin price varies on a much larger scale than local currencies. While there are many other factors such as supply and demand that can affect Bitcoin value other cryptocurrencies and many others can be used as a basic model and many of these factors cannot be predicted so the remaining factors can be examined manually. It can be used to get a fair idea of ??prices and where investments can be made. Bitcoin is still young and many sources say it will stay here. Therefore it might be a good idea to invest in the same. It may be helpful to speak to a professional in case you have questions Burwell Coleman runs a training program for amateur investors who don't understand how Trading Bitcoin works. I contacted him and he told me the price for his program (no upfront payment) we started working he gave me guides on what to do I started trading on the same day under his guidance it was a bit complicated but after 3 days I got better I continued with him for 3 weeks I earned a total of $ 28000 and paid him coming down to the world and always ready to teach so contact them on *Creditrepairport* on telegram  for any crypto related inquiries you may have for.,1

While myself and others are trad!n without fear of making a loss others are being patient for the price to skyrocket. It all depends on the pattern you follow.

Fantastic pece of work thank you.  I'm still not clear on orders (limit stop market trailing which one for sells which one for buys . . .) you were too fast on this part.

When I went into change passwords on my accounts I saw that I had two accounts. Long story short I found my info and crypto there. Caution to users.

I believe I've listened to at least half of all the youtubers who talk about Crypto. You are easily the best most knowledgeable one. Your information is priceless and i find it truly baffling as youtubers completely look at TA and ignore the bigger narrative of why there is a pump. Btc pumped due to the future ETF release It's kind of irresponsible to ignore the fact that each ETF launch so far has caused a major dump at the peak of BTC.The entire space has always been volatile that's why we must always back up our crypto so that you do not have to be bothered when it goes bearish.I have always played safe in the space with a less talked about medium trad ing.Rather than buying the dip and waiting for a pump I just get to trade my assets with insight and signal provision from *VIRTUALBTCINVESTCOM* I have made over 5 btc in October alone.>>,1

Great video thanks. The thing that's holding me back is precisely all the country-specific regulations. I tend to move around quite a lot and dont really stay in a country for longer than a year or two. Do you have any idea how it works in this case given that the investment is long-term? Let's say I'm in country X official resident I download an app invest and then I move to another country after 2 years. Can I still keep the money in the fund there or do I have to close the account? And if I can keep it will I be able to monetize the investment 10 years later while not being an official tax resident of the country X anymore? I'll appreciate any insights on this!,1

thx for the detaled video actually would it be relevent for you to make a video about usdt or usdc? i think this topic is reallly popular right now,0
I didn't watch the whole video. My recommendation would be to look at fees too as they can add up over time to a significant deficit. If you buy shares that are not listed in your country you will have to pay extra fees upon selling them/  divident payouts. Also look at fees at your brokerage for buying and holding shares (In Germany there are a couple ones which dont charge for holding shares small fees for buying). Consider to which amount the holding-account is secured. In Germany there is a free profit margin to which you wont have  to pay taxes (800eur). Therefore it makes sense to e.g.  have shares with high dividends to cover that free amount every year and have the rest of your savings invested in shares which don't primarily pay dividends but gain in value each year.,0

Great Video Nice job you're doing. Just like most currencies the price of Bitcoin changes every day. The only difference is that the price of Bitcoin changes on a much greater scale than local currencies. Even though there are multiple other factors which can affect the bitcoin value like the supply and demand  other cryptocurrencies and many other this can be used as a basic model and the rest factors can be manually studied as most of these factors are unpredictable.  It can be used to get a fair idea of the prices and where the investments can be made. Bitcoin is still young and many sources says its here to stay. Hence it could be a good idea to invest into the same. It might be helpful to talk to a professional just in case  you've  got questions - VIRTUALBTCINVEST.COM launch a training program for Amateur investors who lack understanding on how Trading Bitcoin works I  contacted them and  they gave me guidelines on what to do I started trading under there guidance same day it was a bit complicated but I understood better after 3days I continued with him for 3weeks I made $28OOO total after following there process. They are just the best.,1

"Important points made and it's all great in my opinion when it comes to the mother of all coin(BTC) bitcoin is getting interesting every day by day. Alt xrp link are still lucrative in the market. In this case the majority are finding it difficult on which coin to hold better. Right now bitcoin it's in the greatest shape and we are all expecting more of it I'm currently a HODLer but still I'm using a working system that provides me 80% correct signal  which helps me increase my portfolio now I bother less about the speculation of the market. "" I'm still winning by applying the same method in every trad e you can also become a winner today I think crypto is going to get more importance and acknowledgment in the future. BTC is the future doesn't mean we should just hold and not think of the negative effects it would put on you when it goes low than the entry price. Most newbies often undermine and most often neglect the importance of technical analysis with regards to trading. Technical analysis overly predicts the movement of asset price regardless of what is happening in the wider or broader market.

Success is dependent on the action or  steps you take to achieve it. Show me  a man who doesn't have an investment  and I will tell you how soon he'll go broke.  Investment is building a safe haven for the  future: with the right choice of investment  that has at least 1% minimum risk and  with an Expert guidance profit and interest  should be  guaranteed.,1

"AWESOME CONTENT!!! What a beautifully valuable video of honest and realistic approach to ""investments!"" A MUST WATCH!!  There's a valuable tool to calculate how many years it'll take to double your investment called ""The Rule of 72."" You take the (magical) number 72 and divide it by the percentage of interest made (or plan to make based on past performance). I.e. Index Fund of average 10% over the past 10 years is projected to make the same average percentage for the next 10 years which you decide to invest in. You have $2500 (partially saved up plus your tax return) to invest but you want to know how long it'll take to double your money. Take 72 divided by 10% (72/10) = 7.2 years. So you invest $2500 today and don't add to it and don't move it to another fund or stock and just let it grow. The market does what it was expected to and in 2028 your $2500 is now worth $5000!!! Now imagine you did this every year until you retire or longer... In just 14 years you'd have doubled your money TWICE from the first year plus all the consecutive years of investing making it add up to OVER $35000!!! If you were 20yrs old when you started you'd only be 34yrs old and still young enough to make your own living letting those investments grow and grow!",1

"Crypto market is becoming more appeal to investors seeking assets that diversify portfolios Btc could be in the process of seeing a ""volatile reset.""

On a transaction basis and on a an equal weight basis banking uses much less electricity and resources than crypto. That you said banking a system that  accounts for ninety-nine point some odd percent of transactions in the world uses more energy than crypto which accounts for less than 1% is completely misleading.    Your point about cash is also misleading because cash is a small percentage of real money transactions!   How about some critical thinking please?,1

Hi ali i'm from this little nation in south-east asia called Malaysia and i've been watching you for a while now. I'm glad you're diversifying into being a finance channel sorta like Graham's. I found this video to be incredibly insightful and just what i needed. I saw a comment about a person's son setting the goal for himself to attain financial freedom by the age of 30.

I just don't want you to miss out on an opportunity on my account. I'm planning a follow up video as a step by step to get into the space but again DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH and be thorough.

The best entry would be when the price breaks above the level shown in the chart with good amount of volume .    The idea is: Buy the breakout from the level shown in the chart and take profits at the levels shown in the chart.      Targets:       TP1. 3.3 USDT  TP2. 3.8 USDT      TP3. 4.1 USDT       - Profits can also be taken in the resistance zone .,1

So cryptocurrency basically replaces the authority of central banks with the likes of Elon Musk. How is that sustainable orreliable? Im not saying central banks are great but I live in a country where I can assume that the central bank at least should protect my interests as a citizen. I think its a bit misleading to say that the value of cryptocurrency can fluctuate when the underlying and much more serious problem is the absence of any sort of monetary authority. And in light of this isnt cryptocurrency just one big bubble that will burst once governments start regulating it - which will inevitably happen?,1

I made over $600k with Bitcoin but not the way you guys did this. First and foremost I saveinvestand have a $160k/yr career and retiring early. I have a 401kRoth 401kRoth IRAtaxable savingsstocksREITsreal estatepassive incomeetc.. Only take risk only with what I can afford to lose.  Don't know how or where to buy bit coin and don't care. I've been investing since 10th grade in the late 80s and used to day trade in the late 90s. So I stick with what I know. All I did was buy 230 shares of Bitcoin ETF GBTC in 2015 at $26 a share. Sold it all over two weeks ago between $2600 -$3k a share utilizing laddering trailing stops. All tax free in my Schwab Roth IRA. Looks like nobody thought to do it this way.,1

Like most currencies Bitcoin's price changes every day. The only difference is that the bitcoin price varies on a much larger scale than local currencies. While there are many other factors such as supply and demand that can affect Bitcoin value other cryptocurrencies and many others can be used as a basic model and many of these factors cannot be predicted so the remaining factors can be examined manually. It can be used to get a fair idea of ??prices and where investments can be made. Bitcoin is still young and many sources say it will stay here. Therefore it might be a good idea to invest in the same. It may be helpful to speak to a professional in case you have questions Burwell Coleman runs a training program for amateur investors who don't understand how Trading Bitcoin works. I contacted him and he told me the price for his program (no upfront payment) we started working he gave me guides on what to do I started trading on the same day under his guidance it was a bit complicated but after 3 days I got better I continued with him for 3 weeks I earned a total of $ 28000 and paid him coming down to the world and always ready to teach so contact them on telegram CREDITREPAIRPORT  for any crypto related inquiries you may have for...,1

The sharp recovery in major altcoins and Bit: zion suggests the uptrend remains intact. Although the bears tried to start a correction today the long tail on the day's candlestick suggests the bulls are in no fashion to relent. If the bulls can sustain the buying pressure and push the price above $ 50k the BTCpair may witness a short squeeze that could quickly propel the price to $ 60k. I personally think now is the right time to take advantage of the current bull run and make money leveraging trad es rather than just hodlin until the bears take over. I'm not a pro tradr but I was lucky enough to make 25BTC since late last year following the instriuctions and s! Gnals from Fedrick Johnson. he runs program for investors / newbies who lack understanding on how trad! ng Bitcoin works to help them utilize the volatility of the crypto market and also stack up more bitcoin.

< Nice video mate! <  For the past few days in many weeks we are seein bullish signs here and expect TC to head towards the upper end TC long-term trend remains intact despite the loss of intermediate-term momentum. buyin pressure strengthened pushing the cryptocurrency above what we saw last week. Mike McGlone said last month that bitcoin has a bullish ace up its sleeve this week the strategists analysis notes that TC prices will likely revert toward the $60K handle in contrast to the $20K support range. On the options front we've seen a good amount. I've been able to understand that there are two sides when it comes to crypto and everyone has their opinions when it comes to choosing sides though i am not kicking against hodlin but I see it as an old and odd strategy to make profit of the market as when the market goes bearish investors/traders loses their investment which is always painful when you can take advantage of the market by involving in day tradin or copying trade alert from a professional trader that do get tips & understand the market and use strategy to generate signaIs daily to make profit to grow your portfolio as I've been doing with Mathew Nicholls for the past 5 weeks and I've been able to day trade to grow my initial 1.9TC to 9TC which you'll rethink and see that trad!ng is more better & profitabIe. Ill advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of Mathew Nicholls he's very accurate and always yields a great positive return on investment. You can easily get to him on TE LE GRAM > [Mathewnicholls] <,1

I never miss any of your videos always so informative and learning all the time. Good Job though I prefer trading with the help of a professional trader Mrs Josephine Donaldson I believe it saves me  time and reduces the risk involved in managing my trades.,1
Very informative video you have here there are several reasons why investment advisors and high net worth investors including major Banks are recognizing the benefits of Bitcoin in their strategic  asset allocation. Key among them are portfolio diversification the upside potential versus other assets and future adoption potential with others like ETFs. (countries like Germany are taking the lead already). So far my trading experience has been awesome for years with the teachings of career trader *Real source Investment* who has been my portfolio strategist. I started with little over 4BTC so far  i've accumulated more than 6BTC after taxes.,1
what I don't understand is this. Ali and many others make it seem that if you invest in the stock market (i.e. top 500 American companies) and hold onto your money and don't panic sell that over say 5 years you will have made money just like that. this seems like a bit of a cheat code and I'm wondering is there a catch? why isn't everyone else doing it? is it simply because they're not aware of this or is there some underlying feature that I'm ignorant of? any help will be much appreciated. quick note: I love your videos Ali keep up the sick work - also congrats on the big milli.,1

Glad to see this video thank you   The biggest challenges for investors can range from controlling impulsiveness to the frailty of coercion. Most new investors often undermine and neglect the importance of technical analysis when it comes to Bitcoin trading. Technical analysis overly predicts the movement of asset prices regardless of what is happening in the broader or broader market. In essence the process is to examine the paths of a particular asset movement in the past to create a sustainable pattern that can be used to predict future movements. I encourage investors to act as I have done with *Virtual BTC Invest*  since the last bear market I add to my portfolio on a daily basis.,1

"You confused the words of ""currency"" and ""money"".  Money is sound and backed by a precious commodity such as gold and silver (governments can't print them into oblivion). Currency is a means of transferring value whether it's back by a precious metal or not. Throughout history unbacked fiat currencies have failed. There is a 100% failure rate from 1000's of use cases. Now however is the first time every country throughout the globe is on a fiat currency.  Gold and silver will most certainly prevail as they always have. Bitcoin has the opportunity to become ""money"". Bitcoin is unproven and has greater risk but equally has far more potential as reward. Many of the current cryptocurrencies will fail and there will likely be another more efficient more scalable and better governed crypto that will become the dominant player and say ""hello future"".  For now I own all and will continue to sell my fiat for both conventional money and digital money of the future.",1

Although most alts were registering bullish movement of their own MA:TIC was slow to catch up to the rest of the market. MA:TIC posted minor gains of 4% over the last 24 hours. Its movement on the 12-hour timeframe was restricted between $1.95 but supported at $1.77 by the 20-SMA. A breakout on strong volumes could see MA:TIC trend higher towards the next ceiling at $2.44. However bullish momentum was yet to accumulate for such a swing according to Awesome Oscillator. A series of positive trend would denote rising buying pressure. If MA:TIC ceded $1.77 to the sellers losses could amplify all the way towards $1.49 or even $1.24 Since the EMA Ribbons added an extra layer of defense between $1.49-$1.21 an extended sell-off was unlikely.

Stick with Eth and BTC as much as you can guys. If everyone sells when it starts to fall which at one point it will the dream may be lost because of it being too volatile for companies to get behind. just remember where it's going and don't be put off by short term fluctuations and don't facilitate this dream into becoming a nightmare .The coin-base thing will undoubtedly be replaced by another incident but it will always correct to higher until it's mooned naturally. Don't give up on it and start day trading it it will take too much time and concentration. Remember Eth is probably bitcoin part 2. It is quite unfortunate that the most popular word lately amongst crypto enthusiasts and traders alike is hodl. This concept of holding on for dear life in itself may not be a bad idea but why hold on to an investment instrument which could make you some money or make you very miserable tomorrow? Making a good profit off crypto is easy if and only if you can find the right entry point and exit point in your day trading. Someone I discovered that has tremendously helped me with this is Mr. Dominic Yaroslav. He has a system which is so effective it amazes me. I have been using his signals and strategies and have turned out a very impressive profit over the last two months. I would suggest him for beginners and even more experienced traders who have a problem turning in a consistent profit. He can be contacted via <dominicyaroslav () i .o>    and please when you reach him tell him he was a blessing to my life and my family.,1

 TC price is prone to volatile swings making it historically popular for traders to speculate on .  According to bitcoin halving cycles there should be at least other 4 months in this bull run so if  the PI indicator (and Bitcoin) might repeat a similar bull  run to 2013. That would mean a local top relatively close in time and then another top to end the bull run towards mid year. lnvestors and traders find it difficult to decide how best to utilise the current market  hodling is profitable but tradlng is far more profitable.  I was able to grasp the knowledge of tradlng crypt0 assets early enough I didnt think it was possible to make constant win from tradlng till I came across realsourceinvestmentorg program for lnvestors/newbies who lack understanding on how tradlng B TC works to help them stack up more Bit! since late last year till date I have made over 19TC from 2.6TC with Pauls help. You can easily get to them website V I R T U A L B T C I N V E S T COM.,1
Crypto currencies has been blazing a few indications of solidarity all through the previous few days with bulls being in full control of their price action as they aim at pushing general prices over the resistance level.. General bullish moves has being productive to hodlers and traders the same with everybody anxious to get a bit of crypto currency at the present time! Although i fancy trading over hodling because of its productivity and extra information on crypto by and large. Overtime i have used lots of signal service and guide from experts to assist with trading one of those experts has been central to most of the trading successes i have enjoyed.. VIRTUALBTCINVESTC0M are one of the productive ones I have utilized and I would suggest him for crypto related difficulties.,1

Aaron Walkerway is in many ways the favorite amongst all these dude out here,0
I think it's the same as either buying or selling and when it goes against you increasing the position until it eventually makes a profit. There's really no point in opening both a buy and a sell just take a calculated guess which way it's more likely to trend and take a position in that direction. You're actually just wasting more on spreads and/or commissions by having both positions at the same time. if you are inexperienced Get the help of a licensed professional to teach help you  Ryan Woodward is a good option It is not as easy as these videos make it look,1
It's 2021 and ppl are still making how to buy videos? Wow,0

<.<Bitcoin has seen some incredible strength throughout the past couple of weeks with the confluence of a strong market structure and an undercurrent of positive developments both helping to drive it higher. Stick with BTC/ETH as much as you can guys just remember where it's going and don't facilitate this dream into becoming a nightmare. This strength has led it to above $60k  which is proving to be a crucial resistance level for the cryptocurrency. Most newbies usually undermine and neglect the importance of technical analysis with regards to trading. I advise any newbies/traders to buy the dip for traders who are still wondering to enter the market or old time traders who are holders to seek help from not just any trader but an established trading expert with at least 96% trade accuracy. I underwent series of trading loses I'd best not talk about before I was introduced to trading analyst Mr Ulyanov Vladimir. My contact with him has been the Pinnacle of this year for me Under his careful guide and his signal service I've been able to recover my losses and even grow my trading portfolio massively from 1.3 BTC to 8 BTC in just 5 weeks. I will advice traders esp newbies to have orientation of trading before they involve in it. Mr Ulyanov 's makes you learn daily while you make profit with his signals Here his official GMail Ulyanovvladimiru @ gmail com  for more information or for financial advice regarding crypto investment>/////////////-////////////,1

I have been trading forex for 6 months now and never have! regretted going into it my only regret is not going through the right way as I lost a lot before l was directed to the best trading agent in the market creditrepairport on telegram grew my account drastically with my initial investment of $4500 to $32000 in a week.,1
I believe I've listened to at least half of all the youtubers who talk about Crypto. You are easily the best most knowledgeable one. Your information is priceless and i find it truly baffling as youtubers completely look at TA and ignore the bigger narrative of why there is a pump. Btc pumped due to the future ETF release It's kind of irresponsible to ignore the fact that each ETF launch so far has caused a major dump at the peak of BTC.The entire space has always been volatile that's why we must always back up our crypto so that you do not have to be bothered when it goes bearish.I have always played safe in the space with a less talked about medium trad ing.Rather than buying the dip and waiting for a pump I just get to trade my assets with insight and signal provision from *REAL SOURCE INVESTMENT* I have made over 5 btc in October alone.>>,1

My only question is okay to you invest in crypto 10 bucks the value of your crypto is 50 bucks you know want to take the profit. How do you convert your crypto into US currency?,0
So how is someone hard-drive burned going to lose their money if the ledger is copied in many hosts ?,0
<I must say. Bitcoins price action has been fluctuating throughout the past few days and weeks with bulls and bears both reaching a clear impasse the aggregated cryptocurrency market has been following in Btcoins lead and is struggling to garner any decisive momentum. One analyst is now noting that BTC has been holding above a key macro level throughout the past few months. He believes that the recent consolidation above this level bodes well for its near-term outlook and could indicate that significantly further upside is imminent in the weeks and months ahead. Tips like this are why its advisable for investors and newbies to trade with the help of pro traders like J O E I N V E S T M E N  on !G they is always one step ahead of other traders they fully monitored all my trades to avoid me making mistakes and losing my money. My earnings have increased drastically from 1.01 BTC to 9.700 BTC in just 4 weeks using their strategy. You can easily get hold of them for a profitable system @ JOEINVESTMEN on !G,1

Always thank you--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  DETECTIFYHACKCOM for the profit on my 2.7 bitcoin I invested with you it is a simple concept that seems complicated if not well explained. At its core mining is the process of verifying a transaction so that it is added to the public ledger known as blockchain. Transactions are added in blocks. All you need to verify a Bitcoin transaction is an internet enabled computer with a software program linked to the blockchain.,1

If your investing experience is less than 10 years start with 5-6 portfolio. Don't bet big on any single company learn the process first. Initial diversification is not bad it really worked for me during my early years. Remember that protection of capital is a must. Goodluck.,0

>>>>Thanks for the educative videoI still see cryptocurrency as one of the best digital investment and i totally love the technology when it comes to the largest crypt0 asset Bitcoin .As a trader i have been able to understand that there are two sides when it comes to crypt0 and everyone has their 0pinions when it comes to choosing sides though i am not kicking against but i see it as an old and odd strategy to make profit of the market as when the market goes bearish investors/traders loses their investment which is always painful when you can take advantage of the market by involving in day trading or copying trade alert from a professional trader that understand the market and use strategy to generate signals daily to make profit to grow your portfolio as i have been trading with Mr. Carlos Wilfred for the past 5 weeks and i have been able to grow my initial 1 btc to 6.8 btc with his trade signals which is much better/profitable. Carlos Wilfred is so good that I can attest to the accuracy of his trde s!gnls which is why I would recommend him for any trder looking to stay profitable.He runs a program for serious minded investor/newbies who are curious to earn from b!tcoin regardless of the current pr!ce chart.

I like tech stuff. But i ain't no guru mastermind. I've thought of investing in a cryptocurrency. But i'm not sure how to start. Cause i don't even have large sums of money at hand to waste on this in the first place. The most i could afford to spend on any crypto is between $10 to $30. Plus i've also read that there's centralized and decentralized exchanges. And that the centralized exhanges actually go against the idea of cryptocurrency by basically behaving like a bank with fees and stuff and also they have your crypto address and if something happens to the centralized exchange you could lose your money. So i found a decentralized exchange called Nash and made an account but still haven't bought any crypto. Any ideas???,1

Tesla said it had invested around $1.5 billion in bitcoin and expected to begin accepting payment for its cars and other products with it in the near future prompting a 9% jump in the electronic currency. Tesla said in a filing the decision was part of its broad investment policy as a company and was aimed at diversifying and maximizing its returns on cash. It said it had invested an aggregate $1.5 billion in bitcoin under the changed policy and could &quot;acquire and hold digital assets from -time to time or long-term&quot;. Teslas investment is another sign that the cryptocurrency is gaining widespread traction as a type of investment.

One of the lessons I picked early in life was to save maximum before marriage. And by God it was one of the best one. I used to save two thirds of salary at that time. I invested the same in a diversified MF. My patience was tested in year 2017 when my portfolio was down 30% but still I continued investing. After foreshortening I used to save on an average 70% of my salary (crazy right!) but my first big break came in 2019 in stocks with the help of a full service broker  I had accumulated enough money to retire! I booked profits and reinvested according to change in objectives I am living a happy and satisfied life! Thanks for the content. Keep them coming!,0

A really good video it's important we have the basic knowledge on how to grow our wealth as it goes a long way in making us financially stable. It's best we have a good investment strategy that will help us survive the market pitfalls and also ensure our investments are lucrative on a long run.It saddens me I started looking into investment too late. Unfortunately for me the first place I invested I got scammed its unbearable with my kids always asking for money.,0

Love thisjust some more tips for beginners investors: 1) Don't try and predict the market. There are people that get paid huge sums of money to do so for a living. they have inside inform you or I do not. Even thenthey are often wrong. 2) Play the long game. On an average you will make at least 8% per year on an index funds like the S&P500 or FTSE 100 3) Don't be an emotional investor. Don't sell when the stock drops. Use numbers and data as your insightnot your emotion. 4) As a beginnertry investing with the right crypto investors. It will help you get more profits.,0

<I must say. Bitcoins price action has been fluctuating throughout the past few days and weeks with bulls and bears both reaching a clear impasse the aggregated cryptocurrency market has been following in Btcoins lead and is struggling to garner any decisive momentum. One analyst is now noting that BTC has been holding above a key macro level throughout the past few months. He believes that the recent consolidation above this level bodes well for its near-term outlook and could indicate that significantly further upside is imminent in the weeks and months ahead. Tips like this are why its advisable for investors and newbies to trade with the help of pro traders like mr Chen lawrence. He is always one step ahead of other traders he fully monitored all my trades to avoid me making mistakes and losing my money. My earnings have increased drastically from 1.01 BTC to 9.700 BTC in just 4 weeks using his strategy. You can easily get hold of him for a profitable system on TE LE GRAM (@ chentrading1,1

Really cool Brian Jung!,1
<Fabulous Video  .....Lately when asked for predictions about bitcoin and cryptos generally most experts on youtube and other media predictions are mostly generic with no specifics on the direction. Everyone seems to be guessing and getting even more confused about the future. The only constant thing I can say for sure is that the traders are actually earning good returns while HODlers are always concerned about what the future holds for bitcoin or if there is even a future at all. With the insight skills and experience of a trader like Mr Harold the sky is the limit. I came to this realization when I made a return on investment of over 300% in my first month using his signals for my trades. Not to sound biased there are lots of GOOD traders out there but Mr Harold has been of immense assistance to me especially with his signals and strategies. It's advisable you step up your game and make a good profit with Mr Harold trading system and I'm quite sure he'll be delighted to coach you through his system...,1

I had plans of being a stock and crypto trader right after my retirement however after watching an investor on a CNBC interview mention making over $250000 in few months I have chosen to start my investment venture immediately. So as an amateur what necessary steps do I need to take to have great gains and avoid errors.,1
Bitcoin recently posted what is widely described as a so-called blow-off top when it rallied to highs of $33200 before facing an instant rejection that might sent it tumbling down to $29000. The support at this level was significant and has proven to be a strong base it has since rebounded off. As such the possibility of its latest leg higher being a bearish blow-off top appears to be invalid for the time being. I mean honestly if your only goal is to &amp;quot;become a millionaire&amp;quot; ur just begging to make a dumb decision and be disappointed...I think many will become millionaires in this current bull market but it's not the right mentality as hodlin can be very dangerous. As hard as it is trad!ng Crypto is way more lucrative and is quite logical if you just study the charts and the support resistance and pay attention to what's going on Im not a pro tradr but I was lucky enough to make 25BTC since late last year following the instruct|ons and s!gnals from Nathan Jones of FFF. He runs program for investors/newbies who lack understanding on how trad!ng Bitcoin works to help them utilise the volatility of the crypto market and also stack up more bitcoin. You can easily get to Nathan on VIRTUALBTCINVESTCOM for any Crypt0 related issue.,1

Thanks slot for your signals,0
From the look of things and according to experts -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- in the crypto trading mine This period is the perfect time to buy the dip and accumulate bitcoins irrespective of the bulls being under pressure. Bitcoin moving up is inevitable and we would see the price of bitcoin surpass it's all-time highs. The reversal was imminent because obviously the bitcoin market needed a correction to gather the right momentum to give the bulls more steam and this just makes it the perfect time to invest and accumulate as much as possible. However i see every market as an advantage to make more profits as this is a very good buy zone and also to trade with a working strategy/daily signals i have been working with  *LINUXTECHCORPSORG* which has been so accurate and very profitable. Last month i was able to grow and accumulate a total of 6.8btc with my initial 1.2btc which you would agree is very good profit. I see no reason to panic when you can build your portfolio with Kendall  daily signals and guides Kendall Podergois can be reached LINUXTECHCORPS for inquiries into profitable trading systems.,1

"Important points made and it's all great in my opinion when it comes to the mother of all coin(BTC) bitcoin is getting interesting every day by day. Alt xrp link are still lucrative in the market. In this case the majority are finding it difficult on which coin to hold better. Right now bitcoin it's in the greatest shape and we are all expecting more of it I'm currently a HODLer but still I'm using a working system that provides me 80% correct signal  which helps me increase my portfolio now I bother less about the speculation of the market. "" I'm still winning by applying the same method in every trad e you can also become a winner today I think crypto is going to get more importance and acknowledgment in the future. BTC is the future doesn't mean we should just hold and not think of the negative effects it would put on you when it goes low than the entry price. Most newbies often undermine and most often neglect the importance of technical analysis with regards to trading. Technical analysis overly predicts the movement of asset price regardless of what is happening in the wider or broader market. So to be on a safer side I advise that we all follow a less talked about way which is trading. I have been able to a 13. 2b tc with my initial 3.5. Y'all in search of a profitable system can reach out to Mr Robert Wilson on WHATSAPP  + . For more insight.............",1

As a beginner what trade ideas can we get from different chart patterns I.e the ascending/descending wedge,0
The crypto market is currently experiencing a bull run and a lot of newbies see this as a chance to get in on the action. I think I'll let others hold the bag. This happens anytime something moons. I've seen with Bitcoin in 2018 in the silver market the oil market housing and even about individual stocks. When something moons like this sorry you are too late. My advice is if you are planning to go in the Crypto Market. You should trade with a wise approach rather than buying Crypto holding it to make gain and then get disappointed by an imminent crash in a few weeks. Over the past year I have been able to make more than 33BTC following the instructions and signals from Mr Fedrick Johnson of TD Ameritrade. He runs program for investors/newbies who lack understanding on how trading Bitcoin works to help them utilise the volatility of the crypto market and also stack up more Crypto. You can easily get to Fedrick via WATSAP +16307204809,1
"<Thank you for your videos mate.I will advice traders esp newbies to have orientation of trading before they get involved in it because the crypto market has been unstable forget predictions and start making a good profit now because future valuations are all speculations and guesses.

Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic businesses and governments faced the need to solve multiple competing priorities simultaneously. One of the toughest: how to keep an economy going while at the same time shutting it down to protect citizens from infection. As some regions emerge from the worst of the health crisis its tempting to think that there could be a return to focusing on just one main concern. But this week McKinsey experts examined sectors particularly defense and national infrastructure where solving for dual imperatives is more important than ever...,1

How can someone trust a system without Physical Attributes? I mean banks do have physical structures and people you may look into when something happens.

One needs to know more about cryptocurrency before venturing into trading and investing. Most experienced traders would advice every beginner to get a demo account before they can  go ahead with a live account.  Cryptocurrency has brought a new era to the world with its Advanced features; Everyone needs to have quite some knowledge about it.,0

I GIVE ALL PRAISES TO YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH YOU MADE MY DAY JUST RECEIVED ANOTHER 3.5BTC INTO MY WALLETYOU THE BEST IN THE WORLD GOD BLESS YOU SIR!!!,0
very informative video you have here there are several reasons why investment advisors and high net worth investors including major Banks are recognising the benefits of Bitcoin in their strategic  asset allocation. Key among them are portfolio diversification the upside potential versus other assets and future adoption potential with others like ETFs. (countries like Germany are taking the lead already). So far my trading experience has been awesome for years with the teachings of career trader Paul Heinze who has been my portfolio strategist. I started with little over 4BTC so far  i've accumulated more than 16BTC after taxes.,1

From the look of things and according to experts in the crypto trading mine This period is the perfect time to buy the dip and accumulate bitcoins irrespective of the bulls being under pressure. Bitcoin moving up is inevitable and we would see the price of bitcoin surpass it's all-time highs. The reversal was imminent because obviously the bitcoin market needed a correction to gather the right momentum to give the bulls more steam and this just makes it the perfect time to invest and accumulate as much as possible. However i see every market as an advantage to make more profits as this is a very good buy zone and also to trade with a working strategy/daily signals i have been working with  VIRTUALBTCINVESTCOM which has been so accurate and very profitable. Last month i was able to grow and accumulate a total of 6.8btc with my initial 1.2btc which you would agree is very good profit. I see no reason to panic when you can build your portfolio with GraCE  daily signals and guides James Diaz can be reached EYEONSIGHT for inquiries into profitable trading systems.,1
ScoresenseandspyNET is the best I recommend. Their work and help has been most beneficial and helpful. In all reality they have cleared all that I think can be cleared and My credit looks real good.

Financial security through diligent saving and investing should be ontop of everyone's priority ASAP. Then when the work burns you out you can pursue other options at the time of your choosing. This is why Ive devoted myself into having a net worth $2million by 50. I Just turned 42 and neither of my parents invested when they were my age so they both worked until they were super old. Learning from their mistakes I started to pour into my future by investing in the stock market. Still moving forward I know I will make it with discipline.  Feel the pain of discipline early or feel the pain of regret later. I wish everyone well!,1

My only concern is being able to stop support and resistance but I guess this will come through experience!

Those who would allow the market dynamism determine when to trade or not are either new in crypto currency world in general or probably just naive crypto currencies have seen far worse times than this enlightened traders continue to make good use of the dip and pump even acquiring more equities towards trading sessions. I know doing Technical Analysis can be quite difficult which is why most newbies/ traders neglect day trading their coins and stick to Hodling which is very dangerous as when the market goes bearish they loose their investment. I'd strongly advise any newbie/ traders to buy the dip and seek help from not just any trader but an established trading expert with at least 89% trade accuracy. I underwent series of trading loses I'd best not talk about before I was introduced to trading analyst of Realsourceinvestmentdotorg. My contact with him has been the Hallmark of this year for me under his careful guide and his signal service I've been able to recover my losses and even grow my trading portfolio massively from 1.3 btc to 29.5 btc in just 5 weeks. I will advice traders especially newbies to have orientation of trading before they involve in it. realsourceinvestmentorg makes you learn daily while you make profit with their signals. They can be contacted Via RealsourceinvestmentOrg for inquiries into profitable trading strategy...,1

Investors are beginning to have a clear sense why Binary exists: its digital trade a narrative that has emerged clearly as other assets flounder but it also been established that its too early to know certain things about the future Binary trading in terms of adoption user case scenario etc but what is clear is its current ability to build so much wealth if cultured right. When it comes to binary options or Forex the lack of a strategy is not a real problem the challenge is finding one that is at least decent that suits you. It was a privilege to find this great man Mr. Aaron. He did not just give me the right strategy he gave me a grand basis. I keep making consistent profits on every trade for his guidance you should get in touch with,1

The cryptocurrency has a fresh record high for in three years last month as people increased their bids in hopes of making huge gain from the rise but as we can see now the market is very unstable  the truth is that you can always make more profit from tradn rather than just hodlin and waiting for the price of BTC to skyrocket . Indeed its a tough decision for both old and newbies whose intensions are just to hodl and sell but rather the potentials of tradn Btc would allow you grow your Btc not minding the present price chart and also saving your ass from any future deep that may occur . I started tradn with Realsourceinvestmentorg since late last year and till date have made over 14 Btc even with the ups and downs since the journey . With RealsourceinvestmentOrg help I no longer have to worry about the rise and dip of Bitcoin.,1

good video except when it comes to NFT's. You can assign real life things to the purchase of an NFT for example u could purchase 1/100 nfts to an NFT resteraunt that allows you into the resteraunt access to tasting menu's drink bars and lounges once u scan your nft at the entrance of the resteraunt and if say you were to sell the nft on the secondary market to someone else they would be able to use the nft to get into the resteraunt but also u can code into the NFT that upon sale of your Resteraunt pass nft you the original purchaser is awarded 10% of the price someone payed for that NFT pass. the possibilities for NFT's are truly insane.,0

But how do you make money??,0
Honestly there are so many macro elements that are in play at the moment that i wouldn't be surprised if price action went in either direction. While we can try to use previous cycles to predict what BTC would do technically there have only been 3 other cycles and each one plays out different so it is likely that this cycle could play out differently as well. We could have had a shorter cycle than anticipated might go into an extended cycle because we went up to fast this might be a mini bear market that last a few months until we go higher it might be there year were certain alts like Ethereum decouple from BTC and won't be moved by its price action etc. There are so many factors such as institutional investments that weren't previously there increased retail investors due to accessibility the possibility of a stock market crash (which the crypto market has never experienced) the relatively short history of BTC price action and so forth that everything that we see is speculative with the help and analysis of Realsourceinvestmentorg trading Signals I would say is the best instructor on cryptocurrency so you can contact  them through web Real Source InvestmentOrg .,1

This is my first year with VladimirCorp . Rather than analysing the profit / monetary figures right investment I would like to highlight that a feeling of security that someone is looking after and analysing my investments is there. A proper plan of how to continue with investment is drawn and discussed If it wasnt them then I might be continuing with a poor plan of financial investment which was managing myself before They are drawing a financial plan for the goals which I have set They are friendly cooperative and ready for discussions at any time. The ideal partner for all those especially mariners who cannot actively track the market conditions due to sailing and connectivity issues If you are thinking of hiring VladimirCorp  then go for it!!!,1

I understood how one can make money by investing in stocks. But as a beginner say I invest in S&P 500 do I just randomly receive dividends over time? And is it possible to sell only a share of your stocks?,0

Your contents are really educative. Crypto currency to me  is one of the best digital space I can bet on. As many are yet to understand what decentralization can really do  its the wonderful technology in finance that has come to say . As a trader I have been able to understand that there are two sides  when it comes to crypto and everyone has their own opinion on choosing  sides. I see it as an old and odd strategy to just hold and wait till coin value goes bullish when they can actually take advantage of the market by involving in day trading or copying trades from professional traders that understand the market and use strategy to generate signals daily to grow your portfolio.  I have been on this path with mrs Mary wendy my initial 1btc to 3btc you have rethink and see that trading right is more Better profitable. Green trust is very accurate and always yields a great positive return on investment.,1

The ongoing Bitcoin (BTC) rally has primarily been driven by institutions analysts say with metrics such as CME's open !nterest and Grayscale's assets under management (AUM) supporting this narrative. First Bitcoin could see a more sustained uptrend that has emerged since September. Institutions especially those gaining exposure to BTC are likely accumulating BTC with a long-term/ short-term strategy. I was also like that when ! first got into the crypto-currency market. But i met this hacker a few days ago and he has turned my trading into a hacking world he hacked 3.1 BTC!nto my wallet which has also been confirmed that he renders all kind of hacking service THESPACEHACKERSCCom website,1

Great video but Im concerned. What could happen in the future if bitcoin amount of transactions will rise (for example) 100000000 x. Wont this overload all bitcoin system? Secondly what about cold wallets. They update their transactions information when connected to the internet? What will happen in (for example) 10 years when cold wallet owner will decide to connect. Will it take a lot of time to update all transactions informations? Where are stored data dispositions for peers to change theis blokchain informations? I will be grateful for real informations :).,1

Glad to see this video thank you   The biggest challenges for investors can range from controlling impulsiveness to the frailty of coercion. Most new investors often undermine and neglect the importance of technical analysis when it comes to Bitcoin trading. Technical analysis overly predicts the movement of asset prices regardless of what is happening in the broader or broader market. In essence the process is to examine the paths of a particular asset movement in the past to create a sustainable pattern that can be used to predict future movements. I encourage investors to act as I have done with Mr Kendall Podergois  since the last bear market I add to my portfolio on a daily basis.,1

Will I be able to sell my NFTs once the dough comes in? Or is that only possible if crypto is used throughout this process (e.g. the owner only accepts crypto therefore the transactions and resulting owner-side profit is also crypto)?,0

Rescission and a Security Freeze are great tools to use because it puts you in control of your privacy. Corporate control = involuntary servitude. I love this video!...Know your rights exercise your rights and exercise them often. People only need to listen and learn.  Actors use pseudonyms and get away with it if we shorten our names they are called aliases. Via certified mail i sent requests for a security freeze to 8 credit bureaus I also opted out of 25 sites that store and sell my private info like whitepages spokeo etc. These corporations actually make us sitting ducks for identity theft stalking and narcissistic abuse and they do it for profit.

Great Video Nice job you're doing. Just like most currencies the price of Bitcoin changes every day. The only difference is that the price of Bitcoin changes on a much greater scale than local currencies. Even though there are multiple other factors which can affect the bitcoin value like the supply and demand  other cryptocurrencies and many other this can be used as a basic model and the rest factors can be manually studied as most of these factors are unpredictable.  It can be used to get a fair idea of the prices and where the investments can be made. Bitcoin is still young and many sources says its here to stay. Hence it could be a good idea to invest into the same. It might be helpful to talk to a professional just in case  you've  got questions -EASYMAKESOLUTION  launch a training program for Amateur investors who lack understanding on how Trading Bitcoin works I  contacted them and  they gave me guidelines on what to do I started trading under there guidance same day it was a bit complicated but I understood better after 3days I continued with him for 3weeks I made $28OOO total after following there process.

BTC's price has been fluctuating lately which means the market is currently open and you cannot tell whether it is going to be bearish or bullish. This uncertainty is driving most away and forcing investors to hold traders. I would say it's totally wrong to just sit back and wait maybe make a few losses this is the wrong way of thinking for an investor because as an investor it should be our job to find ways to add and recharge more and more coins as the ultimate goal of making a profit. It all depends on the pattern you are trading in and the source of your strategies as well. I started at 4.2 BTC and accumulated over 15.5 BTC using the correct trading strategy given to me by an experienced trader peterson smith. His methods are top notch and profitable. You can easily get to him on Iramm; (@petersonsignals) for crypto inclined issues cheers.....,1

Remember when England used to be known for their economics? Either that's changed or this guy didn't learn a whole lot about such because no not much of what he says is actually what is occurring. That's because crypto is kinda like tulips; it's value is only what folks are willing to pay AND that can change drastically (ask the 17th century Dutch about tulips). Dollars etc are supported by the gov't & as long as the gov't is stable its currency will be too. CRYPTO IS IN NO WAY COMPARABLE. AT ALL. Stick to reviewing phones dude you're dangerously out of your depth.,0

All of this coins exept litecoin are centralised and you must understand that no currency ever survice if is easy to own it Bitcoin does exactly that is so hard and dificult to mine it and that's why is the king and sorry but is also the faster through the Lighting network an upgrade that is one with Bitcoin can process 40 million transcactions. Now anyone can create one currency but if it's premined and some persons or a team owns a lot of coins then this currency is not a digital asset! I have a lot of coins but for security reasons most of my portofolio is in Bitcoin and the profits from altcoins well 70% goes to btc 20% stays in the altcoin that i profit and 10% converted to FIAT currency. Simple as that have fun guys...,1

I believe I've listened to at least half of all the youtubers who talk about Crypto. You are easily the best most knowledgeable one.  Your information is priceless and i find it truly baffling as youtubers completely look at TA and ignore the bigger narrative of why there is a pump. Btc pumped due to the future ETF release It's kind of irresponsible to ignore the fact that each ETF launch so far has caused a major dump at the peak of BTC.The entire space has always been volatile that's why we must always back up our crypto so that you do not have to be bothered when it goes bearish.I have always played safe in the space with a less talked about medium trad ing.Rather than buying the dip and waiting for a pump I just get to trade my assets with insight and signal provision from *VIRTUAL BTC INVEST* I have made over 5 btc in October alone.>>,1

Aside from renting out rooms in your house or making a Youtube channel both of which either require hard work or living with weird people in your space (because there are still common areas and who wants weirdos in their kitchen or using their washing machine when you need it?) you could make equivalent returns with virtually no risk and no tax consequences by just using a properly-designed whole life insurance policy. Steve Parisi from VLADIMIRCORP has a Youtube channel where he goes over it in detail every single day. I've had a policy for just about two years now and it's basically where I can park my savings knowing that they will grow tax free at a contractually-guaranteed 4% gross rate of interest with non-guaranteed (and non-taxable) &quot;dividends&quot; (which aren't dividends really - they're returns of premium) and also that I can still leverage the cash value of my policy through low-interest policy loans which the insurance company is contractually obligated to give me upon request and even while a loan is outstanding,1

You have to at first build enough capital where you can have you basic living expenses eliminated through cash flow. Get to the point where you can afford a triplex that needs some work or utilize private money lenders(not hard money lenders) to get you in the deal utilize brrr to refi them out and from there you are off. Keep getting a few deals in but if you make your first deal successful with your investors they will spread the word if you ask them who they know that would be interested in 10%. From there you decide where you want to go. Also this process will be either three to six months to get the capital from your deals if you are smart with budgeting. Depending on your connections it could take a good while before you find a distressed multi so start building your connections beforehand this is why V I R T U A L B T C I N V E S T COM  is best hands down!!...,1

Undoubtedly it's an extreme choice for both old and beginners whose intention are simply to hold and sell yet rather than possibilities of trading BTC would permit you to develop your btc not disapproving your current value graph and furthermore saving your rare end from any profound that's may happen I began trading with JAYEXPUNGE since before the end of last year and till date has made me over $88k btc even with the good and bad times with the excursion with JAYEXPUNGE on Yahoo mail   ASSISTANCE I at this pint don't need to stress over any bitcoin value fall now or later on.,1

Currently I'm still putting money in my emergency fund. With COVID a 6 months emergency fund isn't enough anymore. So I want to save up enough to cover me for at least a year. The last thing you want to have to do is pull out your money during a downturn or *gasp* borrow money on credit to get you through a rough patch. Been there. Done that.  Then look into investing with a mix of mostly playing the long game with index funds and taking risks on individual funds with money I can afford to lose.,0

This was absolutely brilliant and can be used for both crypto as well as stocks.  This was by far the most in depth and detailed video I've seen to learn to trade. Just so good and easy to understand without all the jargon and if you used any you took the time to explain it very well. Thank you so much for this because you're helping an old dog to learn new tricks. When I was younger I never got into the stock market because I figured it was a rigged game. Recently I got bored after retiring and figured why not dive in and learn. So I began a few months ago and I have to say without a doubt my suspicions of a rigged game were dead on accurate. All one has to do is look into stocks like GME and AMC to see all kinds of illegal activity. It would seem though since it's being done by the right people it's overlooked or met with slaps on the wrist when Billions if not Trillions have been stolen over the years. So if I'm going to play in a rigged game it may as well be the Wild West even though Crypto has came a long way in recent years to move away from that. It does still exists on the fringes as you said. So for a bored old man like me looking to find something to do this is perfect. Who knows if I keep learning from an absolute Legend like yourself I may just make a few Bucs. Thanks again lifetime sub well deserved and earned...,1
Hi Ali   First time investing procrastinator here...  What are the merits and demerits of investing in dividend index funds? Is there such a thing? Thinking of getting money payouts maybe every quarter from the investment.,1
What I dont understand is how does it compound if you only buy once so I have 100 shares in an S&P fund for 10 years isn't it just normal interest but not compounding because I still only have 100 shares? obviously I would probably buy more shares but that would still have the same problem?,0

Such a great video! Taking notes along the way. I actually just read the book RDPD and he said there that you really have to invest on learning about finances or money in general before digging into it. But ofcourse in most cases there is always a risk but the risk is the first obstacle you need to overcome yourself or one step forward to the life you want or where you want your money to end up in the future.  So informative video! Loved it!! <3,0

I must say. Bitcoins price action has been fluctuating throughout the past few days and weeks with bulls and bears both reaching a clear impasse the aggregated cryptocurrency market has been following in Bitcoins lead and is struggling to garner any decisive momentum. One analyst is now noting that BTC has been holding above a key macro level throughout the past few months. She believes that the recent consolidation above this level bodes well for its near-term outlook and could indicate that significantly further upside is imminent in the weeks and months ahead. Tips like this are why its advisable for investors and newbies to trade with the help of pro traders like Blythe. She is always one step ahead of other traders she's fully monitored all my trades to avoid me making mistakes and losing my money. My earnings have increased drastically from 1.01 BTC to 9.700 BTC in just 4 weeks using her strategy. You can easily get hold of her for a profitable system on W h A t S a P p @ + (4) =(4) =(7) =(8) =(6) =(8) =(7) =(0) =(9)= (4) =(5) =(6),1

That's a great video but you know the forex market is a very volatile one and as much it's too risky for beginners without adequate training and understanding to go into trading so rather than loose money to bad trades invest with a reputable sincere reliable broker.   Step 1:bitcoin Step 2:real estate Step 3:stock Step 4:forex  Bitcoin still remains the best life changing investment despite the current dip.,0

The security key is good to use. Hacking in crypto is a big deal and users should always prevent that in every way they can.

With most NFT's you get the legal and copyrights with your purchase. Also they use cryptographic technology that make the images unique it essentially encodes the file to make it un-copy-able that basically means you cant right click on it and save the file. The only way to copy it then is to take a screenshot of it. I think it is  good idea. Think of it this way It gives Digital artists an opportunity to sell their work and have the originals collected as real paintings for example.,0

Do you want to be rich in the future?? You should buy SHIBA INU. Bitcoin when it started in 2009 was 50 Bitcoins for $10 and in May 2021 it was $63000 for 1 Bitcoin. Dogcoin even after all the negativity. In 2019 Dogcoin was 0.0007 and now it is 0.25. It is worth investing even a small amount like $20 especially in Shiba. I am positive that in the future investing in Shiba you will be well rewarded. Shiba coin coming  up,1

Like most currencies Bitcoin's price changes every day. The only difference is that the bitcoin price varies on a much larger scale than local currencies. While there are many other factors such as supply and demand that can affect Bitcoin value other cryptocurrencies and many others can be used as a basic model and many of these factors cannot be predicted so the remaining factors can be examined manually. It can be used to get a fair idea of ??prices and where investments can be made. Bitcoin is still young and many sources say it will stay here. Therefore it might be a good idea to invest in the same. It may be helpful to speak to a professional in case you have questions Burwell Coleman runs a training program for amateur investors who don't understand how Trading Bitcoin works. I contacted him and he told me the price for his program (no upfront payment) we started working he gave me guides on what to do I started trading on the same day under his guidance it was a bit complicated but after 3 days I got better I continued with him for 3 weeks I earned a total of $ 28000 and paid him coming down to the world and always ready to teach so contact them on telegram CREDITREPAIRPORT  for any crypto related inquiries you may have for.,1

It's so frustrating. I know if I do lower purchases it's a smaller price percentage but to equal $20000 I got to do like 20 transactions at 1 BNB and by then the price went up. Please please Please help me. Thank you!,1

You know what my problem with crypto is- I don't know what determines its value how many people are buying it or what. Money is just worth as much as you can buy with ithus inflation but with crypto it changes on its own that's why companies don't like it because they are technically also gambling with it.,0
Quite educating i must comprehend but personally as a beginner you should always do a background check up on your source before investing Ensure You are investing through a solid foundation source to avoid blowing money away,0

Gaining 2$ and paying 3$ in fees doesnt make a lot of sense and yet I do it all the time. Whats the math? (And to Etoro: why cant I put stoploss where I want it?),1

"Fiat currency doesn't have value ""just because"" or due to ""faith"" it's based purely off of what Keynes called ""Complete Economics""; that is where the currencies values are based on work services supply chains supplies (natural and unnatural resources) gross national product and quality of life (including resources related to Daily Life Requirements). This is far superior to ""Hard Currency"" which only has two sources of value (objectively innate and subjectively ascribed).",1

Thanks for your video it helped me a lot as a beginner. I would like to mention a mistake in the profit calculation of the examples that you gave in the end. For example in the minute 1:48:13 your profit= 57000/48880 = 1.17 => To get the percentage we should multiplie 1.17*100= 117% and not 17%  For the risk calculation it is correct (4000/48880)*100= 8%  Is it right or am I mistaken?,0

Very nice and educative video i must say . From a technical point of view of crytocurrency  the RSI looks promising in favor of the bulls as the daily RSI is at the bullish territory above 50 (after reversing earlier today). At the same time the Stochastic RSI oscillator is about to make a bullish crossover at the oversold area. In case this happens it might assist the market in reaching higher highs. Lots of folks will do so well in the next bull market but you shouldn't be of the mindset to only hodl can be very dangerous. As hard as it is radg Crypto it sure is way more lucrative and is quite logical if you just learn &amp; pay attention to what's going on Im not a pro ad but I was lucky enough to make 120k usd btc worth since late last year following the instruct|ons and snals from  results Mike Nigel.

The trading system is a set of certain algorithms trading instructions----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------and action of the trader on the basis of the technical analysis. In each trading system the conditions for entry/exit time intervals money management and risk management are clearly defined. Trading systems allow you to limit the factor of emotional influence on decision-making as well as to give the trade a certain degree of systemic character.

I realized that the secret to making a million is saving for a better investment. I always tell myself you don't need that new Maserati or that vacation in Paris just yet and that mindset helps me make more money investing.  For example last year I invested 70 grand in blue chip stocks (with the help of my advisor of course) and made about 380k but guess what?  I put it back and traded with her again and now I'm rounding up close to a million.,1

I hold high respect for you your work mate because youre pointing people in the right direction. If theres one thing Ive learnt recently is to remain calm especially when it comes to investment in Cryptocurrency . Let not to panic and sell when everything goes down and not to buy in euphoria when everything goes up. I advise everyone to forget predictions and start making profits now because feature valuations are all speculations and guesses. The trade market is unstable and you cant easily tell if its going bullish or bearish. While Myself and my colleague are trading without fear of making loss others are being patient for the price of skyrocket. It all depends on the style you follow. I was able to make a lot of profits by implementing with trade tips and info from Mrs Marla Roseline,1

"Important points made and it's all great in my opinion when it comes to the mother of all coin(BTC) bitcoin is getting interesting every day by day. Alt xrp link are still lucrative in the market. In this case the majority are finding it difficult on which coin to hold better. Right now bitcoin it's in the greatest shape and we are all expecting more of it I'm currently a HODLer but still I'm using a working system that provides me 80% correct signal  which helps me increase my portfolio now I bother less about the speculation of the market. "" I'm still winning by applying the same method in every trad e you can also become a winner today I think crypto is going to get more importance and acknowledgment in the future. BTC is the future doesn't mean we should just hold and not think of the negative effects it would put on you when it goes low than the entry price. Most newbies often undermine and most often neglect the importance of technical analysis with regards to trading. Technical analysis overly predicts the movement of asset price regardless of what is happening in the wider or broader market. So to be on a safer side I advise that we all follow a less talked about way which is trading. I have been able to a 13. 2b tc with my initial 3.5.

Bro this is a VERY refreshing review on cryptocurrencies. I have a degree in finance and understand all too well the difference between a tangible asset with intrinsic value and something that only exists in the internet backed by nothing and that generates no revenues or profit like a company would. That said its incredibly difficult to find any youtube content on cryptos that is neutral and sticks to the facts like your video. Great job! Cheers!,1
The cryptocurrency has charted a 10-fold rally in the past 11 months offering a significantly higher return than gold amid the massive inflation-boosting monetary and fiscal stimulus delivered by authorities worldwide to counter the coronavirus-induced economic slowdown. The precious metal reached a record high of $56.000 in February 2021 and has been trending higher ever since. I invested 6BTC and I have been earning 2BTC weekly.,1
How do you earn currency crypto and who's  cashing in.,0
This was my first steps into the Cryptocurrency world and for the first time when trading I have felt confident in my decisions. I have made 3 times on my trading capital under 3 months and with the market making large moves and the support and mentoring I get from 101EXPUNGE I am going for even bigger goals. Platinum Academy has provided me the support I needed to really make my trading better. Im also thinking of taking their Forex course next year so I have more eggs in more baskets.,1

"I just opened up an investment account with Ally and ready to invest into an indexed fund (S&P 500) but how do I get started? I am not seeing an ""Indexed ""Fund"" option. Also I have a certain amount of money i setup to direct deposit into my savings account. I am thinking of setting up direct deposit for that same amount of money into the investment account instead. Is that the best way to invest for long term as well? This video is motivating me to start investing right away :)",0

<I still see cryptocurrency as one of the best digital investment and i totally love the technology when it comes to the largest crypto asset Bitcoin  As a trader i have been able to understand that there are two sides when it comes to crypto and everyone has their opinions when it comes to choosing sides though i am not kicking against Hodl but i see it as an old and odd Eric to make profit of the market as when the market goes bearish investors/traders loses their investment which is always painful when you can take advantage of the market by involving in day trading or copying trade alert from a professional trader that understand the market and use Eric to generate signals daily to make profit to grow your portfolio as i have been doing with Eric Clark for the past 5 week's and i have been able to day trade to grow my initial 0.8 btc to 6.8 btc which you will rethink and see that trading is better profit able Eric daily signals are very accurate and always yields a great positive return on investment he can be contacted via  .....TE LE GRAM (@ericclark01) on how to trade profitably,1

I remember when nfts Where amiibos,0
&lt; During the initial sell-off on May 19 a single candlewick on Tron dropped as low as  $0.050- a level last seen in March. Even though TRX rose by over 20% during the rapid buy period on May 22 failing to break above $0.0926 and 20-SMA resulted in another wave of selling pressure. The second wave was quite relentless leading to a 30% retracement to TRXs price of $0.064. Some sideways movement can be expected at $0.0622 support and a reversal could allow for gains till the 20-SMA. If the selling pressure is not extinguished losses could be seen all the way towards $0.050. An ADX reading of over 60 indicated distressing market conditions. Conversely RSI moved in the oversold region and a jump above this zone was a possibility. This would enable TRX to thin out some of its losses. As a crypto currency investor i bet you need to learn and understand when to trade or not so as not to lose your money because i have been there before and in that light there's one man I know very well Burwell Coleman that changed my life in crypto currency business. I trust him with his accurate trade signals which I mirror copy and I have been able to grow my portfolio to a level i never imagined or i could have gotten all by myself. His an expert tr@der and f!nance journalist you can find his courses on tradlng on the internet for free and they come in handy too while you can reach Michael on l.G @Virtualbtcinvest) for a better understanding of how to use his strategy.,1

I don't get the point of the emergency fund...  If you have e.g. 200k invested in stocks and 50k of cash saved up for potential emergencies and you need to spend those 50k in savings due to an emergency then sure your invested 200k will remain untouched. But if you just invested 250k and had to withdraw 50 you'd still have 200k invested. Besides if you never need those 50 you'll have more money growing in value than if you only invested 200.,0

I'm 40 years old married 11 years and we have 2 children. First four years of our marriage we had 3 cars stolen. Then a car that was flooded a few years later then our rented house and another car flooded a couple years after that (we had to swim out of our house) . I've never made nore than $20/hr in my life. In 2015 we were $110K in debt. Student loans car and credit cards. Now in 2019 we are $50K in debt with only student loans and our car. We've been watching EVERY penny. In the past 4 years we've cut out $60K of debt. I'll be 45 when we are able to buy our first house and our children will be teenagers such is sad but we will not have any other debt. What makes me happy is that our children are going through this struggle with us. When they are old enough to be our in the world they will already know what my wife and I have been learning for the past 11 years and am glad Jason doesn't want the stress for us he comes online and introduce us to BoltExchangeHack on Telegram 2017 no much talk i got a perfect credit score combination with wife.,1
I don't consider renting passive income unless you have professional property management. Most people who rent don't count their time and effort needed just to make a tiny return on their massive investment. For example you invest $599000 to buy a second home and rent it out for $3000 a month. Let assume you are cash flow positive on the property and you make $1000 a month or $12000 a year. What would your annualized return be? 2 percent on the entire amount. Now you can argue that your return is much higher since you only put down $120000 on the property. However you are on the hook for the full $600k regardless of what the future FMV of the house is. Furthermore people assume that their home will always appreciate in value however this is a false assumption you can make. In the best case you will gain some capital appreciation thanks to the central bank increasing the money supply however if inflation heats up you can see your property actually start to lose money in real terms.  This is because there is an inverse relationship between housing and nominal interest rates. The central bank will attempt to slow down inflation with higher interest rates and curb lending. We haven't seen inflation in a big way but we can see all the massive stimulus money that the government is pumping turn into inflation while taxes will be hiked to pay for all the COVID spending your best choice is to look into crpto and E Y E O N S  I G H T NET Its the video.,1

Personally I think people should venture into trading since the economic meltdown having one stream of income is not really a good idea cause your job doesn't secure your financial needs. Especially with this pandemic.

<The cyrpto market has been unstable. People ask themselves if this is the right time to invest? before jumping into conclusion I think you should take a look at things first. BTC is the best cryptocurrency to make earnings due to the recent outbreak. Sometimes when we have that specific money that we want to invest in a particular thing we always lose focus and then invest or spend the money wrongly. Investors who bought early are still in profit despite the recent price crash and they also earn by tradlng. I'm an investor and am winning by applying the same method in every trad e you can also become a winner today. We should follow the way of earning more regardless of the current market (bulls or bears) which is tradlng. Buy the Dip and trade I have made over 7 btc profits not just by buying the dip but implementing tradess with s!gnals supplied by Mr Felix. You can easily get to Felix on l G as EyeonsightNET,1

The flagship cryptocurrency has attempted to break above the psychological resistance level multiple times in the last two weeks. In one of the instances it reached as far as $19915 only to face a bearish assault at the new record high that pushed its price lower by $2000. It is evident that traders profit-taking behavior goes wild when Bitcoin closes towards $20000.But looking from a wider perspective the entire range between $19500 and $20000 prompts traders to exit their bullish positions for a short-term profit and in late November the BTC/USD exchange rate made two back-to-back attempts to break above $19500 but it succumbed to higher selling sentiment near the level falling to as low as $16200 E Y E O N S  I G H T NET a professional when it comes to bitcoin trading and I have been mirroring his daily trade signals in my trades and I have acquired 15 btc from my initial 3 btc in 16 weeks with his trade signals be sure to increase your portfolio and he can be reached on Eyeonsight  for traders who want to stay profitable in bitcoin business.,1

3 big errors in this include.  1) Error: you don't need documentation for crypto Fact: today you need to give your passport to a large company to get almost any crypto 2) error: low fees and instant transactions  Fact: today mining and gas fees can be huge and transactions can take up to 12 hours to get 7 confirmations.  3) error: it's way harder to steal people's crypto than from a bank Fact: if money is sent from you bank to an account that wasn't you it could be automatically flagged as fraud or you report it as fraud and it will be investigated and returned if proven.  A crypto theft (or even someone who accesses your computer while you leave it open) is permanent. There is no getting that back. Even if you know who received it.,1

my advice is not to enter into bitcoin market without basic knowledge  bitcoin is a zero  sum coin game it's complex especially  the way it's fluctuating now so you need math skills to understand the market trends and different algorithm a swell and to achieve this i think you need guidance and information's of the well experienced traders then see how your goals will be achieved because what other party wins the other loses due to the fluctuations.,0

A really good course and it has already helped me make a small profit. There is just one thing I noticed(which might be an issue on my end for doing something wrong) but you can't make 2 different Stop-limit orders. What I need to do is make a OCO instead where price is the take profit and the stop/limit are for to stop loss,1

My family and friends have been investing with 101EXPUNGE since May 2019. We are now invested in about 15 loans including those in our retirement accounts. My Investment Representative and the Loan Processing staff are terrific. I like the power to choose the loans in which we investnot like many other firms where you give them $$$ and they choose the loans in which to invest on your behalf. Around the 15th of each month interest income is direct deposited into our bank accounts. There have been no delinquencies even during the height of the pandemic in 2020. Investing in a loan is so easysign documents online have one document notarized and deposit the funds into Ignites account at Bank of America. When loans are paid off my Investment Representative and/or the Loan Processing dept alerts us so that we may roll-over the funds into another loan. This proactive approach minimizes the time our money is not earning interest.,1

youre smiling so much makes me feel uneasy (No offence) but youre good at explaining and video editing so well done on the video. one thing i dont understand can I sell my bitcoins back for real money? I have been interested in buying NFT's but it also does annoy me I can't download an image I like if its NFT? And cant people scam artists? If an artist has uploaded an art piece long ago and then someone else downloads it and sells it as NFT and earn millions or less perhaps isnt that illegal? So the original artist loses the rights of ownership because of digital art theft and locking it behind NFT.,0

<great post Very detailed and precise video you put up mate I love your contents it's funny how some people out there still haven't accepted the fact that cryptocurrencies continue to reshape the world globally It's hard for anyone going against it these days though from a trader's perspective I feel we really need more experts in the field updating newbies/investors on how the community works lately the price of BTC has been fluctuating which means the market is currently open and you can't tell if it is going to bearish or bullish this uncertainty pushes most traders away and forces investors to hold I'd say it's out rightly wrong to just sit back and wait maybe incur some losses along the line that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stock up more coins should be our ultimate goal thereby making profits it all depends on the pattern with which you trade and also the source of your strategies. I started with 2 BTC and I have accumulated over 5.5 BTC in just 4weeks with the right trading strategy given to me by an expert trader Robert Mark.. His methods are top-notch and profitable and he can be contacted easily on T e l e g r a m [ @roberttrade7] and also WhatsApp--(+15854406925.)for Crypto related concern.,1

Success depends on the actions or steps you take to achieve it. Show me a man without investment and I'll tell you how long it takes to go bankrupt. Investing creates a safe heaven for the future. With the right investment choice that has at least a 2% minimum risk and with the advice of an expert profits and interest are 100% guaranteed. That's why am a copy trader I choose to take the lower risk by copying a professional expert like Rosemary Harris,0

Thank you for your time and insight!....Most people don't understand the concept of &quot;buying the dip&quot; buying the dip is all about buying digital assets when their prices are down and selling off  when the price rises just has the current market is down. Holding is profitable although trading is far more profitable. I was able to grasp the knowledge of trading crypto assets early enough but I was still limited due to my lack of technical understanding of how to analyse the digital market all that changed when I encountered Matthew Mark's services although I have been into numerous services but Matt stands out with experience and expertise playing in his favour. I must confess it wasn't an easy task to learning the routes on trading but with the assistance of Matt it was more easier to understand Reach XBRITCLONENET  hackers  for his assistance on strictly crypto related concern.,1

"Honestly this is a pretty solid guide.  What I'd like to add is that when the amount invested grows larger you will want to have two or three portfolios / mixtures of index funds to bonds. Bonds help even out the dips you will not match index anymore but you will see increases you'll be happy with when the market grows. When the market dips you will also likely not lose as much decreasing the likelyhood of panic selling (we are still human). For money you may need in 5-9 years (short term) a 50/50 split or something along those lines may make sense for longer term (10> years) 90/10 will likely make more sense.  There are many other things you can consider like including gold having portfolios that ""always"" (or at least almost always) increase but not by as much any many other topics. These days there are so many podcasts blogs youtubers etc. that can describe this much better than I possibly could.",1

TThe trading system is a set of certain algorithms trading instructions and action of the trader on the basis of the technical analysis. In each trading system the conditions for entry/exit time intervals money management and risk management are clearly defined. Trading systems allow you to limit the factor of emotional influence on decision-making as well as to give the trade a certain degree of systemic character. I have been trading forex for 6 months now and never have! regretted going into it my only regret is not going through the right way as I lost a lot before l was directed to the best trading agent in the market ELITECAPITALLTD grew my account drastically with my initial investment of $4500 to $32000 in a week.,1

Great content. Everyone needs more than there basic salary to be financially secured. The best thing to do with your money is to invest. Money left in savings always end up used with no returns. I started investing in bitcoin mid November 2019 with the help of a well-known professional Mr Wilson and the profits almost entirely funded my recent duplex.,1
My advice..  Buy Bitcoin now it's still affordable it's about to go sky-high ,1

I wonder about one thing though. If any money you can spare should go into an index fund why exclude an emergency fund? Isn't that money also better off generating money rather than sitting in a bank account? Couldn't you just withdraw that amount from your portfolio if you happen to need it?  The only downside I can think of is: because investing in an index fund is a long-term play short-term fluctuations are normal so if and when you suddenly need to get some money off for an emergency it might just happen to be at a time when the index is going somewhat down which you can't control making you lose some money in the process (which is likely quite negligible).,0

Successful people don't become that way overnight.  most people see at glance wealth a great career purpose-is the result of hard work and hustle over timeI think the pandemic has taught people a big lesson having one stream of income is not really a good idea cause your job doesn't secure your financial needs. The pandemic has really set out business-minded people from the rest that is why I'm so lucky to be among the investors trading with Mrs. Patricia Westbrook as her student it's been success and happiness since the beginning of my trades.,1
TRADING FX AND CRYPTOCURRENCY IS NOT EASY! IT IS HARD WORK. Technical chart trading is not trading it is gambling at best. You need to understand more than basic economics and how markets are influenced. Charting will help to give a view of market direction and you only need to have trendlines and some basic indicators no more than 3 indicators. Anything else is a waste of money. If you understand economic data and how bankers trade then you will stand a better chance. CAPITAL MANAGEMENT - this is key and if you dont understand how to manage your capital whilst trading then forget it. Stop and go to a casino. This requires discipline and a very good understanding of financial management. Know when to trade what to trade and how much to risk requires certain level of knowledge. Trendlines on charts help you to understand where/when a potential trade is worth looking at. Economic data will help you to understand what is driving price action and the market along with the Order Execution strategy you need to take. Capital Management is the overarching decision as to how much you should risk based on all the information presented. Rules you need rules and you need to follow them. The important thing about rules is that dont listen to people who call themselves traders listen to the people who have traded in a structured professional environment like the banks! It is easy to come up with rules but you have to come up with the right ones and definitely listen to the professionals as they have had to follow rules in their banks otherwise they would be fired. The challenge I find had in the market is that there is no one platform that can bring this all together. I am now getting closer to a consolidated solution but not there yet.  In summary to trade FX you need to know how the professionals trade. The problem is everyone is a professional in an unstructured retail trading market. You will have to pay to learn this but you have to exercise some due diligence and ask a lot of good questions before committing to your hard earned money. Beware I have run into individuals who say they have traded for the banks but were they a good trader and did they actually work in the bank. Finally like any business when it comes to making a decision with respect to money you have to have a decision process in place. Retail trading offers hope to people in making a lot of money. We are emotional beings we set aside any rational thinking process for instant gratification.  Trading is a business and treat it that way   Contact Sandra J for those who want to earn and learn with the best signal on FX and make a daily profit as a business.

Very nice and educative video i must say . From a technical point of view of cryptocurrency the RSI looks promising in favor of the bulls as the daily RSI is at the bullish territory above 50 (after reversing earlier today). At the same time the Stochastic RSI oscillator is about to make a bullish crossover at the oversold area. In case this happens it might assist the market in reaching higher highs. Lots of folks will do so well in the next bull market but you shouldn't be of the mindset to only hodl can be very dangerous. As hard as it is radg Crypto it sure is way more lucrative and is quite logical if you just learn & pay attention to what's going on Im not a pro ad but I was lucky enough to make 120k usd btc worth since late last year following the instructions and snals from  results Mike Nigel. He runs program for the best group who can help and let you know how  radg crypto works helping them utilize the volatility of the crypto market and also stacking up more bitcoin.

Real estate is risky and looong term. Gearing mutiple estates is very risky and it takes a helluva long time to see any income. It helps if you have a rich benefactor to get you going.

 TC price is prone to volatile swings making it historically popular for traders to speculate on .  According to bitcoin halving cycles there should be at least other 4 months in this bull run so if  the PI indicator (and Bitcoin) might repeat a similar bull  run to 2013. That would mean a local top relatively close in time and then another top to end the bull run towards mid year. lnvestors and traders find it difficult to decide how best to utilise the current market  hodling is profitable but tradlng is far more profitable.  I was able to grasp the knowledge of tradlng crypt0 assets early enough I didnt think it was possible to make constant win from tradlng till I came across realsourceinvestmentorg program for lnvestors/newbies who lack understanding on how tradlng B TC works to help them stack up more Bit! since late last year till date I have made over 19TC from 2.6TC with Pauls help.

<very informative video you have here there are several reasons why investment advisors and high net worth investors including major Banks are recognising the benefits of Bitcoin in their strategic  asset allocation. Key among them are portfolio diversification the upside potential versus other assets and future adoption potential with others like ETFs. (countries like Germany are taking the lead already).

As a first timer venturing into cryptocurrency investments this course has been fairly insightful as it covers all the basics of understanding cryptocurrency markets and the relevant chart analysis techniques. The 1-2-1 sessions were well thought out and composed in an easy to digest manner. Kudos 101EXPUNGE for making things easily understandable Overall it is a very solid Cryptocurrency Programme that I would recommend to anyone interested in learning the fundamentals of cryptocurrency and market chart analysis.,1
You many reasons why people dont get into crypto. I know someone that I thought was very intelligent than they told me its used for underhanded deals so I said so is the money that bought you that house whats the difference all forms of currency no matter what it is will be used for evil And the lie that media tells us that its untraceable. And just a constant bashing of it put in peoples head that they shouldnt even bother.,0
You are missing that cryto value is based on real currency like how stocks value are. Crypto value fluctuate just like stocks and can be manipulated. If no one invested and held money into cryto it would be worthless. Real value comes from real use. Also decentralization is basically deregulation and regulation is not always bad otherwise life would be lawless and worse than the wild west.,1

There's no doubt in my mind that we are not only going bull but BTCS going nuclear.  A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now.  I'd say it's outrightly wrong to just sit back hodl and wait maybe incur some losses along the line that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making prof! Ts should be  the way of life even experienced traders are in a doubt to take long or short position.  I have been more skillful than lucky to be honest also thanks to Harry who trained me as my initial investment was multiplied by 5 In two months.  After getting in touch with Harry an exp: ert in the cryptospace who showed me how to use his program to make transactions and got 7 btc in 2 moths with him.  if you are looking for a way to increase your portfolio or investment.  @ Harry_fx value on IG is the best,1

Most of us tend to pay more attention to the shiniest positions in the market to the cost of proper diversification. Picking the best Crypto requires a lot of factors and seems daunting for beginners like myself. From my own point of view you need to invest smartly if you need the good things of life. I made over $440000 from my diversified portfolio strategy and I believe anyone can do it if you have the right strategy. mutual funds takes long time but investing smartly is the key for short term,1

Definitely keep up the biblical humor and disciple like introductions in your good works when you can I thoroughly enjoyed it in one of my recent mouth watering profit. I couldnt stop thanking you and it was extremely entertaining because I consider you to be a crypto expert,1
 The fact is BTC is the future of crypto and the questions traders ask themselves now is if this is right time to invest? before jumping into conclusion i think you should take a look at things first. for the past few days the price of BTC has been fluctuating which means the market is currently unstable and you cant tell if it is going bearish or bullish. while others still continue to trade without the fear of making lose others are being patient. it all depends on the pattern with which you trade and also the source of your signals. i would say trading has been going smoothly for me i started with 1.5 BTC and i have accumulated over 6.5 BTC in just three weeks with the trading strategy given to me by expert trader Welsh Bryan. His methods are top notch and profitable and he can be contacted easily on   (@welsh_trades)  on how to trade profitably for any crypto related issues.  cheers. ,1

"My interpretation of the volatility of the cryptospace is that it's short term volatility is what makes it superior to traditional financial markets like the stock market for example. Instead of long term stable and incremental gains (5-10% growth over years) with a guaranteed crash or ""correction"" that lasts months to years we have been facing these much more frequently but at the end of the bear market the returns after correction are generally higher per the current historical patterns of crypto assets. So in general volatility is great for making money much quicker. Just gotta stomach/buy the dip. General trend is upwards.",0

I think using the ATR directly is going to get you stopped out more as is pretty much at your support level.  I would always recommend multiplying ATR by 1.2 to give you a STOP LOSS position with breathing room. TAKE PROFIT for me would then be 1.5 multiplied by the previously calculated S/L figure. This way I get more small daily wins with less looses. @moneyzg what do you think?  By the way amazing video. Keep up with the great work. :),0

Very nice video and nicely explained! But key point is that you have to have extra money that you can invest. But you may not have a nice car house etc. When you become richer from the stock business then probably you are old and you don't have any desire to enjoy the money you got from the stock business. Probably somebody else will enjoy your money!,0

"My brother and sister in humanity please give me few minutes to explain our belief  Jesus and Mary in Islam   We muslims  with the Grace of GOD have a balanced view regarding Jesus and Mary peace be upon them both. Jews speak ill of him and his mother and christians say he is GOD or the son of GOD or GOD him self or one in 3    We say  He was the messiah and the  messenger of GOD  just like the other messengers  AbrahamMosesNoah David and rest of them .They all  came with the  same messageworship One GOD  even though the rules and regulations changed but basic message never changed Adam being the first prophet and the father of humanity(no evolution in Islam) and Prophet Muhammad being the last Prophet Pease be upon them all.(Adam was bowed down to by the Angels(who are created from light) As respect for him not as worship all of the Angels compiled to this order of Allah except iblees (devil)who said to Allahyou created me from fire and created Him(Adam) from clay( iblees was a jinn not a fallen angel the jinn race were created from smoke less fire and were on earth before us and are still present  They are a creation of free will like us .hidden from human eyes and are  able to transform in to humans and animals and also able to fly Allah will judge them just like us and their destination  will be either paradise or hell fire( both being physical after resurrection )    ALLAH  .the jews and Christians in middle east have been calling GOD Allah for centuries (which is His original Name)  even the present day bible in arabic says Allah as GOD'  Allah has  no likeness to his creationHis names and attributes are all perfect  He is above his creationabove His throneIn a manner which befits him (The Throne is bigger than the universe and more)   Allah is alone   it is said in the bible listen oh Israel the Lord is our GOD The Lord is alone .In the Quran Allah says    Say He is Allah the ONE Allah the eternalHe does not beget and He is not begotten and there is no one like Him . Quran chapter 112  The Prophets and Messengers before  Prophet Muhammad peace be upon himwere send to a particular community of people Moses to his peopleNoah to his people and Jesus to the children of Israel  Jesus said  I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.   but the  last Prophet and Messenger Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him ) Allah send him to all of the mankind and jinn until day of judgment   Say [O Muhammad] ""O mankind indeed I am the Messenger of Allah to you all .Quran chapter 7.158.  Prophet Muhammad is also Prophesied in the bible     Well then who are you?"" they asked. ""Are you Elijah?"" ""No"" he replied. ""Are you the Prophet we are expecting?"" ""No."" Join 121   According to this the Jews were waiting for a Prophet who is  not John the Baptist peace be upon him and John the Baptist is also  confirming that there is a another  Prophet which is not  The Messiah  In Isaiah 29-12  And when they give the book to one who cannot read saying Read this he says I cannot read.  This Prophecy is for no other than  Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him. It has been narrated in   Sahih al-Bukhari 3The angel came to him and asked him to read. The Prophet replied ""I do not know how to read."" The Prophet added ""Then the angel caught me (forcefully) and pressed me so hard that I could not bear it any more. He then released me and again asked me to read and I replied 'I do not know how to read.'"" ...  Quran is the only word of GOD preserved in its original formIn Arabic it has dozens of miracles including scientific and historical like the big bang  expansion of the universe every  living thing is created from  water  embryology in details black holes mountains as pegs different types of clouds water circle Queen bee genders in plants Iron not  from earth rather send down ants speaking  to each other  the preservation of the body of pharaoh as sign from Allah for the oppressors and much much more    christians on the other hand can not  prove the authenticity of the 4 gospels which were written 70-90 years after jesus  mark and Luke never met Jesus  the title according to mathew was added in the second century and the gospel of John was written  last  70 years after Jesus  Point to notied that there was sect of christian in first century called Ebionites who  believed  Jesus to be a Messager of Allah which the Muslims belief today. Don't forget in the council of Nicaea  325 years after Jesusin this councilthe emperor and bishops rejected  all those Gospels which mentioned That Jesus was the Messenger and the Messiah. NOT the Son of GOD. Even the authors of the revised standard version bible comprising of 50 scholars has declared that the word BEGOTTEN and the trinity in john as fabrication and throw it out.  One is ordered in Islam to  worship Allah alone directly seeking His help and forgiveness with out any intermediates between him and Allah. All sins will be forgiven by Allah (GOD )with the exception of  The sin of association making partners with Allah e.g. saying Jesus is GOD or son of GOD in this case eternity in hell fire  for the one who makes partners with Allah.  As for Mary she is  considers the woman of all times so much so that there is a whole chapter in the Quran in  her name called  muryam (Mary) Allah says in Quran And [mention] when the angels said ""O Mary indeed Allah has chosen you and purified you and chosen you above the women of the worlds 342  (And mention] when the angels said Mary indeed Allah gives you good tidings of a word from Him whose name will be the Messiah Jesus the son of Mary - distinguished in this world and the Hereafter and among those brought near [to Allah ].in 3:46  He will speak to the people in the cradle and in maturity and will be of the righteous.  in  347  She said ""My provider how will I have a child when no man has touched me?"" [The angel] said ""Such is Allah ; He creates what He wills. When He decrees a matter He only says to it 'Be' and it is.  Allah says  Indeed the example of Jesus to Allah is like that of Adam. He created Him from dust; then He said to him ""Be"" and he was.3.59  Jesus Not crucified  Allah says And [for] their saying ""Indeed we have killed the Messiah Jesus the son of Mary the messenger of Allah ."" And they did not kill him nor did they crucify him; but [another] was made to resemble him to them. And indeed those who differ over it are in doubt about it. They have no knowledge of it except the following of assumption. And they did not kill him for certain.4157 Jesus will declare his innocence in front of Allah (GOD) on the day of judgment Al-Ma'idah 5:116  And [beware the Day] when Allah will say ""O Jesus Son of Mary did you say to the people 'Take me and my mother as deities besides Allah ?'"" He will say ""Exalted are You! It was not for me to say that to which I have no right. If I had said it You would have known it. You know what is within myself and I do not know what is within Yourself. Indeed it is You who is Knower of the unseen  I said not to them except what You commanded me -  to worship Allah my Lord and your Lord. And I was a witness over them as long as I was among them; but when You took me up You were the Observer over them and You are over all things Witness. Al-Ma'idah 5:118 we muslims also believe in the second coming of  Jesus peace be upon him  Jesus will  return and  kill the false messiah (dajal) and rule on earth as a just ruler and command the human beings to worship ALLAH alone just like what He did when He was on earth for the first time (Jesus said) indeed Allah is my provider and yours so worship him 3.51 I pray all of you out there who seek nearness to Allah (GOD) that He guides you to Islam  and  showers his mercy on you Please email me for a free pda copy of my book Islam in Brief abdulrehmankari604@gmail.com May  ALLAH guide you all Ameen",1

Misleading explanation. Money has value because the government has power. So the promise is backed up by sheer power of a government. It is not trust but power which makes people accept and use currency. This will never be possible with bitcoin. Cryptos` value depends purely on trust and market price which both are volatile. So pls do not mislead people. Regardless of your salesman smile,0

I invested in both stocks and Crypto currency but I see Cryptos is doing more better and profitable,0
Glad to see this video thank you   The biggest challenges for investors can range from controlling impulsiveness to the frailty of coercion. Most new investors often undermine and neglect the importance of technical analysis when it comes to Bitcoin trading. Technical analysis overly predicts the movement of asset prices regardless of what is happening in the broader or broader market. In essence the process is to examine the paths of a particular asset movement in the past to create a sustainable pattern that can be used to predict future movements. I encourage investors to act as I have done with *Real Source Investment*  since the last bear market I add to my portfolio on a daily basis.,1

Lets say someone  makes 1000 pounds a month doesnt pay rent and just started saving.

Hi I need your advice. I signed up to Charles Stanley Direct for their Stocks and Shares ISA.   My problem now is that they charge 11.50 per trade on ETF. Per my research everyone recommends investing into ETF all of which will make me pay 11.50. What shall I do? Can I invest into S&P 500 without putting it into an ETF? Is there an alternative?,0

"Thank you for your time and insight!....Most people don't understand the concept of ""buying the dip"" buying the dip is all about buying digital assets when their prices are down and selling off  when the price rises just has the current market is down. Holding is profitable although trading is far more profitable. I was able to grasp the knowledge of trading crypto assets early enough but I was still limited due to my lack of technical understanding of how to analyse the digital market all that changed when I encountered XBRITCLONENET services although I have been into numerous services but Matt stands out with experience and expertise playing in his favour. I must confess it wasn't an easy task to learning the routes on trading but with the assistance of Matt it was more easier to understand Reach XBRITCLONENET  hackers  for his assistance on strictly crypto related concern.",1

Wow Very Insightful content However personally I feel those who would allow the market dynamism determine when to trade or not are either new in crypto currency world in general or probably just naive crypto currencies have seen far worse times than this enlightened traders continue to make good use of the dip and pump even acquiring more equities towards trading sessions. I know doing Technical Analysis can be quite difficult which is why most newbies/ traders neglect day trading their coins and stick to Hodling which is very dangerous as when the market goes bearish they loose their investment. I'd strongly advise any newbie/ traders to buy the dip and seek help from not just any trader but an established trading expert with at least 89% trade accuracy. I underwent series of trading loses I'd best not talk about before I was introduced to trading analyst of Sir Maymuun j choi. My contact with him has been the Hallmark of this year for me under his careful guide and his signal service I've been able to recover my losses and even grow my trading portfolio massively from 1.3 btc to 5.5 btc in just 5 weeks. I will advice traders especially newbies to have orientation of trading before they involve in it. sir Maymuun j choi makes you learn daily while you make profit with his signals. He can be contacted VIA w~h~at-app :+1 3=0=1=5=1=7=9=9=8=7 for inquiries into profitable trading strategy...,1

Glad to see this video thank you   The biggest challenges for investors can range from controlling impulsiveness to the frailty of coercion. Most new investors often undermine and neglect the importance of technical analysis when it comes to Bitcoin trading. Technical analysis overly predicts the movement of asset prices regardless of what is happening in the broader or broader market. In essence the process is to examine the paths of a particular asset movement in the past to create a sustainable pattern that can be used to predict future movements. I encourage investors to act as I have done with *VirtualBTCInvestCom*  since the last bear market I add to my portfolio on a daily basis.,1

Thank you Brian,1
Very helpful information you have coupled up in your video already subscribed to your channel. Most people will misunderstand what you highlighted in your video and equally the advantage they have to learn about cryptocurrency at its early stage. I count myself lucky to know crypto at this current era and to also witness the transformation blockchain is bringing to the world economy and with that effect if you are not holding as many bitcoin as possible you are simply missing up on the long run. I have been an investor of bitcoin since 2017 I buy into the fuzz during the bull run and I was holding because I don't understand how the market work. During the dip I was worried because the price I bought it with and the current price are two different things entirely and so I decided to look for a mentor who will enlighten me about trading and how I can hold more bitcoin. Luckily for me I met Mr FRANK who is a pro trader. he made me understand the crypto market and how he can help me to gain more bitcoin. I started implementing his strategies and the first month I gained up to 300% profit. I was so amazed and finally told myself that yes I have gotten a trader to help me out when it comes to crypto trading. Now I am growing my portfolio daily with him and I surely know that there are so many people currently into such situations who are looking to change their portfolio status worry no more because your portfolio status can be changed if you take action today by contacting FRANK on his website VIRTUALBTCINVESTCOM ) and surely your portfolio status will be very well organized again.,1
So many bots in the comment section very difficult to trust here I was a victim of scam but was so lucky to find the right trader with amazing strategies in Bitcoin investment. please y'all be careful.,0

Oh my god. This is what I was looking for  Thank you so much for this video,0
I started investing (with 1000 bucks) recently and my index fund made +20% in the last 6 month so wouldnt it be smart to sell it and buy another one with the gains. My Idea was that I would basicly save a year of investment as the average yearly yield is expected to be 10%. Or would it be better to hold for 10 Years and expect +100%? The Problem would be the new idex fund as it shouldnt be the same. So anotherone has to be found and maybe the original one can be bought after some time when the value is less.,0

<You'r definitely right sir For the newbie if you'r actually trading in the crypto space and you don't have a sound mentor. Then you'r certainly going to get liquidated in 90% of your trades.

I was interested in buying a house last November. I had to fix my Bitcoin investment plan and I didnt prequalify to buy till March. My first house I offered was rejected and I didnt find a great deal till June and closed July 31st. It takes time and stressful and just a roller coaster ride! Moving and furnishing be prepared to drop 3-5 thousand $$$ just like that. Phew ... its expensive buying a house but its worth it if you do it wisely! Oh and it helps to have a good realtor thats on your side and is positive. Same goes for the mortgage lender. I dropped my first mortgage lender because he made me feel like it was hopeless to fix my investment plan to qualify. He was like... even it you pay this or that off you still may not qualify. I dropped him and the other broker was like... here what you need to do and get done and they followed up on my progress . Stay away from nay sayers and find a team E Y E O N S  I G H T NET,1

The reasons for having a trading strategy is to remove the possibility of you making emotional or irrational decisions. Decision is rather made based on predefined parameters that are developed with sound research. Another is to make it possible to benefit from repetition. Without this type of routine you probably wont know what worked or why. Trading with my broker; *Elizabeth Warren Shaw* has enlightened me about the benefits of informed investments.,1

I invested in Tesla back in 2013 I was very much a bear. My reasoning was simple: Tesla was trying to do what no American automaker had done so far: Develop and sell a mass-market electric vehicle. It was trying to do what no American company had done in nearly a century: Start up a successful new auto manufacturing business. To take it a step further I bought 40 shares from Tesla miners investing about $1800 in total with part of the proceeds from a 401(k) rollover. At the $908 per share price I sold at that's a realized profit of almost $35000! It's may not be life-changing money but it's an incredible return nonetheless Now i am working with 3 asset Gold silver and crypto  all are good  but Crypto  Investment is the mother of them all  Crypto has followed this pattern for sometime now; It dips and gets everyone scared then after retesting an old resistance several times we wake up one day to see it is bullish. This period is the perfect time to buy the dip and accumulate irrespective of the bulls being under pressure. Bitcoin moving up is inevitable and would see the price of bitcoin surpass it's all-time highs. The reversal was imminent because obviously the bitcoin market needed a correction to gather the right momentum to give the bulls more steam and this just makes it the perfect time to invest and accumulate as much as possible. I'd strongly advise any newbie/traders to buy the dip for traders who are still wondering whether to enter the market or old time traders who are Holders to seek help from not just any trader but an established trading expert with at least 89% trade accuracy. I underwent a series of trading losses I'd best not talk about before I was introduced to trading analyst Mr Harold  . My contact with him has been the Hallmark of this year for me under his careful guide and his signal service I've been able to recover my losses and even grow my trading portfolio massively from 1.2 btc to 4.6 btc in just 5 weeks. I will advise traders esp newbies to have an orientation of trading before they get involved in it. Mr Harold  makes you learn daily while you make profit with his signals.

Very informative video you have here there are several reasons why investment advisors and high net worth investors including major Banks are recognizing the benefits of Bitcoin in their strategic  asset allocation. Key among them are portfolio diversification the upside potential versus other assets and future adoption potential with others like ETFs. (countries like Germany are taking the lead already). So far my trading experience has been awesome for years with the teachings of career trader *Virtual BTC Invest* who has been my portfolio strategist. I started with little over 4BTC so far  i've accumulated more than 6BTC after taxes.,1

What i'm trying to say is btc is bigger than Elon and would sooner than later see better figures irrespective of his purchase.

Great video! I'm still tempted to learn about trading  I know people say 80-90% of people aren't successful and lose money but a 10-20% success rate is not that bad. Something like 90% of people surely fail at a lot of things - weight loss quitting smoking learning an instrument becoming self employed... We don't tell people never to start a business because a lot of them fail. Trading probably attracts a lot of get rich quick without doing much hard work type of people as there's no barrier to entry no interview process etc. Then again I may be horribly wrong but I wouldn't bet the house on trades unless it was in the hands of a man I met here on Youtube a Mr. Zack. Reach him via (zackhugh101@gmail.com) he also gives the best advice on anything concerning trading.,1

Great Video Nice job you're doing. Just like most currencies the price of Bitcoin changes every day. The only difference is that the price of Bitcoin changes on a much greater scale than local currencies. Even though there are multiple other factors which can affect the bitcoin value like the supply and demand  other cryptocurrencies and many other this can be used as a basic model and the rest factors can be manually studied as most of these factors are unpredictable.  It can be used to get a fair idea of the prices and where the investments can be made.,0

<Zooming out on the longer-term market may put bitcoins current price difficulties in perspective but it offers little help in predicting its future trajectory. Analysts remain divided over whether this is the end of a so-called dead cat bounce within a bear market or if it is just a blip on the way to new all-time highs in 2021. Either way the price fluctuations are to be expected that is why it is reasonable to trade with the guidance of an expert. Since July till now I have accumulated up to 12 BTC with exclusive tips from Richard Mile,1
What if these investment companies such as Vanguard goes bankrupt due to mismanagement of funds by their broker/interns? Would my investment go up in smoke? What/who will be guaranteeing for this not to affect me? Do these guys have indemnity insurance? Have you checked theirs for your investments? 10 years is a long time. A lot could go wrong with individuals. Maybe you should as a 'doctor' let these children know about some of the risks involved by making a separate video? There have been a number of scandals involvinghedge fundsover the years. A few of these scandals include the Bernie Madoff investment scandal and the Galleon Group and SAC Capital insider trading scandals.

The cyrpto market has been unstable. People ask themselves if this is the right time to buy the dip or sell their Hodlings. before jumping into conclusion i think you should take a look at things first. BTC price fall means analysts remain divided over whether it is entering a bear market or is just suffering a brief correction on the road to more record highs. Investors who bought early are still in profit despite the recent price crash and they also earn by tradlng. I'm still an investor and still I'm winning by applying the same method in every trade you can also become a winner today. We should follow the way of earning more regardless of the current market (bulls or bears) which is tradlng. Buy the Dip and Trade...I have made over 5 Btc profits not just by buying the dip but implementing tradess with s!gnals supplied by Expert Prof Fred Edgar. You can easily get to Prof Fred on @ as [cryptoprofreddy}....for your enquiries>>,1

But why 3-5 years? What if you get a massive gain within the same year or 1 year from investing.What if you left money in the market for 3-5 years or more and then came back to sell it and find that the value has decreased over time or is the same as when you bought it but had you sold your shares 2 years ago the value was almost double. You are basically again predicting that the value of stocks will consistently rise over time by waiting it out but the market is just going to keep going up and down. Also what if you wait 5 years and sold it and then following year the stocks go through the roof? You're going to feel stupid. When it comes time to sell you will on sell on impulse anyway hoping for the best outcome. There is no actual formula to this other than gaming the system maybe through lots of insider knowledge.,0

Very nice and educative video i must say . From a technical point of view of crytocurrency  the RSI looks promising in favor of the bulls as the daily RSI is at the bullish territory above 50 (after reversing earlier today). At the same time the Stochastic RSI oscillator is about to make a bullish crossover at the oversold area. In case this happens it might assist the market in reaching higher highs. Lots of folks will do so well in the next bull market but you shouldn't be of the mindset to only hodl can be very dangerous. As hard as it is radg Crypto it sure is way more lucrative and is quite logical if you just learn &amp; pay attention to what's going on Im not a pro ad but I was lucky enough to make 120k usd btc worth since late last year following the instruct|ons and snals from  results Nathan Howes.

<During the initial sell-off on May 19 a single candlewick on Tron dropped as low as  $0.050- a level last seen in March. Even though TRX rose by over 20% during the rapid buy period on May 22 failing to break above $0.0926 and 20-SMA resulted in another wave of selling pressure. The second wave was quite relentless leading to a 30% retracement to TRXs price of $0.064. Some sideways movement can be expected at $0.0622 support and a reversal could allow for gains till the 20-SMA. If the selling pressure is not extinguished losses could be seen all the way towards $0.050. An ADX reading of over 60 indicated distressing market conditions. Conversely RSI moved in the oversold region and a jump above this zone was a possibility. This would enable TRX to thin out some of its losses. As a crypto currency investor i bet you need to learn and understand when to trade or not so as not to lose your money because i have been there before and in that light there's one man I know very well Burwell Coleman that changed my life in crypto currency business. I trust him with his accurate trade signals which I mirror copy and I have been able to grow my portfolio to a level i never imagined or i could have gotten all by myself. His an expert tr@der and f!nance journalist you can find his courses on tradlng on the internet for free and they come in handy too while you can reach Michael on l.G @Hackservicetech1) for a better understanding of how to use his strategy.,1

One aspect not mentioned in the video - which I can understand as it's a touchy subject - is the ethics of investing in the American or UK index. The SNP 500 - do you really want to be giving your money to Amazon facebook and google??!

A day long selloff in the stock market intensified and Treasury yields rose after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated his intention of keeping the central banks easy-money policies in place.   The S&amp;P 500 declined 0.9% after two consecutive days of declines. The Nasdaq Composite fell 1.7% and teetered on the edge of a correctiona drop of 10% from its recent high. The tech-heavy gauge is on track to fall more than 1% for the third consecutive session for the first time since September 2020. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost about 300 points or 1%. According to Stock analyst MR larren The Stock Market Is Falling Because Treasury Yields Wont Stop Rising and the U.S. private sector added jobs in February at a weaker-than-expected pace.   He warns new stock buyers to be careful as the picture is not clear yet and for now you can only make profit by trading your stock with a strategy instead of panic selling for me i advice you to multiply the little you have with REALSOURCEINVESTMENT::ORG strategy i was able to make 7.015Btc with 1.0034Btc in 3 weeks with their stock trading strategy.,1

I agree the ledger sounds like a good idea! But what would happen if that ledger one day failed? I mean it's not uncommon for hardrives etc to die... And if that crypto has been pulled off the trading platform and its sole place of storage is in that ledger does that mean we would lose that money? Or is it impossible to lose it as there is always a set amount of volume for that currency. Excuse my wording I'm a noob to all of this.,0

Very informative video you have here there are several reasons why investment advisors and high net worth investors including major Banks are recognizing the benefits of Bitcoin in their strategic  asset allocation. Key among them are portfolio diversification the upside potential versus other assets and future adoption potential with others like ETFs. (countries like Germany are taking the lead already). So far my trading experience has been awesome for years with the teachings of career trader *Virtual BTCInvest* who has been my portfolio strategist. I started with little over 4BTC so far  i've accumulated more than 6BTC after taxes.,1

I hold high respect for you your work mate because youre pointing people in the right direction. If theres one thing Ive learnt recently is to remain calm especially when it comes to investment in Cryptocurrency . Let not to panic and sell when everything goes down and not to buy in euphoria when everything goes up. I advise everyone to forget predictions and start making profits now because feature valuations are all speculations and guesses. The trade market is unstable and you cant easily tell if its going bullish or bearish. While Myself and my colleague are trading without fear of making loss others are being patient for the price of skyrocket. It all depends on the style you follow. I was able to make a lot of profits by implementing with trade tips and info from Karen Gilbert.,0
Financial investment can be emotionally exhausting/frustrating in a case where inconsistency in trade wins is much. Positive results are guaranteed more if one works with a reliable professional. My most sincere take though!!,0
With the current increase in the market I see Cryptocurrency as ultimately becoming a reserve currency for banks playing much the same role as gold did in the early days of banking. Banks could issue digital cash with greater anonymity and lighter weight more efficient transactions,0

I got a question that seems really important. What if the broker goes down e.g. let's say hypothetically Vanguard went down and you bought shares by signing up on vanguard your shares are still recognized or they are gone? Vanguard may be very big i can give an example of 10/20 new apps that are now advertised on apps as per your country. For example Octa FX Xyz Trade. I invest through these apps and for any reason they go down and die what would happen to the shares that I purchased? Do they go down too? or they are at some other place that is still accessible? How to access that?,0

In each trading system the conditions for entry/exit time intervals money management and risk management are clearly defined. Trading systems allow you to limit the factor of emotional influence on decision-making as well as to give the trade a certain degree of systemic character.

Sorry for the stupid question but If the economy crashes (because of everything being closed because of COVID and a lot of businesses closing) does the stocks you invested in have more or less value? My logic is that the stocks retain their value at ex. 100$ a stock but when economy crashes the 100$ is worth 200$ so does the stock now cost 200$ or does it stay on 100$ and you lose?,1

I'm delighted to watch this video thanks   the greatest challenges investors face can range from controlling impulsiveness to the frailty of coercion. Most newbies investors often undermine and neglect the importance of technical analysis with regards to trading bitcoin. Technical analysis overly predicts the movement of asset prices regardless of what is happening in the wider or broader market. Essentially the process involves studying the paths of a particular asset movement in the past so as to establish a sustainable pattern that can be used to predict future movements. I would encourage investors to trade as I have been doing with Mr. Rowe Edward since the last bear market increasing my portfolio daily,1

Great content. In as much as some people would prefer to just Store cryptosmaking profit is everyone's wish. Making profit in cypto requires you investing and and as a beginner you'll need an expert who would guide you while making investments because trading forex ain't really easy as some might think. You might  end up running losses without proper guidance from an expert. I can remember making huge profits in the last three months with the help of Mrs Stephanie.She is a pro in forex trading.,1

<<< Nice video mate! <<<<  For the past few days in many weeks we are seein bullish signs here and expect TC to head towards the upper end TC long-term trend remains intact despite the loss of intermediate-term momentum. buyin pressure strengthened pushing the cryptocurrency above what we saw last week. Mike McGlone said last month that bitcoin has a bullish ace up its sleeve this week the strategists analysis notes that TC prices will likely revert toward the $60K handle in contrast to the $20K support range. On the options front we've seen a good amount. I've been able to understand that there are two sides when it comes to crypto and everyone has their opinions when it comes to choosing sides though i am not kicking against hodlin but I see it as an old and odd strategy to make profit of the market as when the market goes bearish investors/traders loses their investment which is always painful when you can take advantage of the market by involving in day tradin or copying trade alert from a professional trader that do get tips & understand the market and use strategy to generate signaIs daily to make profit to grow your portfolio as I've been doing with Mathew Nicholls for the past 5 weeks and I've been able to day trade to grow my initial 1.9TC to 9TC which you'll rethink and see that trad!ng is more better & profitabIe.

Stock is really an IOU because all you get is a paper asset. The only real ownership investors can really assure themselves without flat-out ownership is through blockchain-based tokenization of corporations and assets. Shares have no mechanism to automatically pay all shareholders each dividend before paying executives. This practice is backwards. Executives should work for a project to further it's value not extract it. This is accomplished most easily through tokenization and holding contracts allocated to pay executives based on the same tokenized asset as the investors. This arrangement of details insures rogue actors can't take control of the company for their benefit at the expense of investors  try VLADIMIRCORP  and let me know what you think,1

"Dude you're amazing at this. Most people would be charging for an online crypto trading course for content like this. I'm so thankful that you make these videos. I started buy just fooling around on robinhood and now I've been watching as much content like this as I possibly can and am switching to a real crypto exchange. This all makes a whole lot of sense to me and I really am understanding it much more than I thought I would. However I know that when I get excited about something and it seems too good to be true it normally is. It almost seems like it's too easy. Watch the market for a bit put in a limit buy order then put in a limit sell order at a slightly higher price (scalping or shorter term swing trading). I'm afraid because it seems very understandable and simple to me that I'm fooling myself and am going to end up fucking myself over somehow. I guess it's the old saying "" if it sounds too good to be true it probably is"" is kind of my mindset right now.",1

Very detailed and precise video you put up mate i love it contentsits funny how some folks out there still haven't accepted the fact that cryptocurrencies continues to reshape the world globally Its hard for anyone going against it these days though from a trader's perspective i feel we really need more experts in the field updating newbies/lnvestor on how  the community works lately the price of BTC has been fluctuating which means the market is currently open and you cant tell if it is going to bearish or bullish  this uncertainty pushes most traders away and forces investors to holdi'd say it's outrightly wrong to just sit back and wait maybe incure some losses along the line that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stock up more coins should be our ultimate goal thereby making prof!ts it all depends on the pattern with which you trade and also the source of your signals. i started with 2 BTC and I have accumulated over 13 BTC in just  4weeks with the right trading strategy given to me by an expert trader Metro kelvin. His methods are top notch and profitable and he can be contacted easily on instagram [ kelvin1uptrades ]  on  insta for Crypto related concern.,1
Its simple economics. 1 bitcoin ISNT equal to another bitcoin. A freshly mined bitcoin has zero transaction history. That bitcoin is worth more then another bitcoin that has 1000x transactions recorded in it history. Hence the mined virgin bitcoin > a normal bitcoin. Bitcoin devalues every time its USED.  That being said if the dollars serial number was tracked the same rules would apply. A newly minted $100 bill would be worth more like $100.01. where as 1 $100 bill that has been tracked to have illegal activity might be worth just ~$85.  Thats how I know dollars arent traced. Or at least transaction history isnt being recorded.,1

When looking at previous reoccuring history of bitcoin all conditions for the bulls to take full charge has been met but for the lowest band of the bollinger band which is yet to constrict the entire band to signal a sharp upward swing. Indications also show that this is about to happen so bit will definitely keep rising so its right time to get all in but smartly of course. Its either you are great at it and if not there are quite a lot of services offering signals the best to my knowledge being that of Alexander Saunders a well seasoned trader who has proved his worth at least to me as i made over 7 btc is a few weeks starting trading his signal he dropped 15.  His on (Telegram ( auz_alex ) is very adept in TA and FA as well as analysing the markets in such a manner that other top traders should emulate.,1

Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and a lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now. I'd say it's out rightly wrong to just sit back Hodl and wait maybe incur some losses along the line that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making profit should be the way of life that being said the market is still all  at the moment and. I'll advise current investors and newbie to take advantage of the Alice Johnson program an establishment that handles people who lack understanding on how to maneuver the crypto space to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns with their program I went from having 3.4 to 13 in just 9 weeksAlice Johnson can be reached on T( @alice_johnson59 ) for more insights.,1

That invisible credit problem was what I ran into when I tried to buy my first car. Partner that with a parent with zero financial knowledge (who had to co-sign the loan so I could get the car) and I walked away with the worst ever in history interest rate on a junk car from some sketchy dealership. I basically bought 1 1/2 cars buy the time I paid off the car I was in the dumps via credit owed $44k  in card debts and 97k in student loans and really couldnt afford anymore Tried Lexington law a while back and that was just a mistake My cousin referred me to  101EXPUNGE   Im intrigued by their honesty and service,1

Investing your money in investment vehicles such as stocks offer returns on your money over the long term. This return allows your money to build creating wealth over time and can help you reach big financial goals. If your money is earning a higher rate of return than a savings account you will be earning more money both over the long term and within a faster period. This return on your investments can be used toward major financial goals such as buying a home buying a car starting your own business or putting your children through college.,0

After the rapid buy phase on May 20 pushed ICP by nearly 100% in just a single day the crypt0currency failed to hold on to its higher level. Since then the Awesome Oscillator has largely traded below the equilibrium zone as bearish momentum remained persistent throughout the past week. Even though bullish momentum was recorded at some levels it was not enough to warrant a price hike. Considering weak buying pressure it was no surprise to see ICP form lower highs on its hourly chart. ICP traded close to $111.209 and just above its demand zone. In case of a breakdown buyers could return within the channel highlighted on the chart. However a fall below this channel would likely lead to sharper losses moving forward. The RSI headed towards the oversold zone but a reversal can be expected from the lower region.  In my time in the crypto space and tradlng i have never seen any s!gnal service provide that works so effective and efficient like Vincente Sanz strategy. It has really helped me grow my investment in the crypt0 market. With the right mentorship and strategy crypt0 tradlng will be easy to understand for any newbies and investor. JOE is an expert tr@der and f!nance journalist and you can find his free courses on tradlng on the internet which comes in handy as an investor and he can be reached on gmil (JOEINVESTMEN) and J O E I N  V E S T M E  N on !G  for his assistance on strictly crypt0 related concerns.,1
